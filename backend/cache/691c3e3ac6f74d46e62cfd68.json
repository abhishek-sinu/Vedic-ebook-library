{"content":"Antya-khaṇḍa\n\nCBP 1: Meeting Again at the House of Śrī Advaita Ācārya\n\nChapter One: Meeting Again at the House of Śrī Advaita Ācārya\n\nThis chapter is the beginning of the Antya-khaṇḍa, which mainly deals with Lord Śrī Gaurahari's transcendental ecstatic pastimes of preaching the holy name as a sannyāsī.\n\nThis chapter describes Mahāprabhu's stay in Katwa on the night He accepted sannyāsa from Śrī Keśava Bhāratī, the Lord's instructing Mukunda to begin kīrtana, the Lord's bestowing love of God on Bhāratī and His departure towards Nīlācala with Bhāratī, the Navadvīpa residents' feelings of separation and a voice from the sky, the Lord's entrance into Rāḍha-deśa, His sudden change of direction from westward to eastward, the Lord's arrangement of sending Nityānanda to Navadvīpa to pacify Mother Śacī and the devotees, the Lord's arrival in Phuliyā and the Navadvīpa residents' meeting with Him, the Lord's arrival at the house of Advaita Ācārya in Śāntipura, His hearing about the science of the Absolute Truth from the mouth of Acyutānanda, Nityānanda and the devotees' arrival at Śāntipura, the Lord's performance of ecstatic dancing and chanting at the house of Advaita, and the Lord's sitting on the throne of Viṣṇu and revealing His own glories.\n\nAfter displaying His pastime of accepting sannyāsa from Keśava Bhāratī in Katwa, Śrī Gaurasundara spent that night in Katwa. He ordered Mukunda to perform kīrtana, and He personally began to display wonderful symptoms of ecstatic love as He started dancing. In the course of dancing, Śrīman Mahāprabhu mercifully embraced Keśava Bhāratī, and Bhāratī immediately manifested symptoms of loving devotional service in his body. When early the next morning Śrī Gaurahari asked Śrī Keśava Bhāratī for permission to leave, Bhāratī expressed his desire to accompany the Lord in His ecstatic performance of saṅkīrtana to search for Kṛṣṇa. Keeping His spiritual master in front of Him, Mahāprabhu proceeded towards the forest with a desire to manifest His pastime of searching for Kṛṣṇa. He also ordered Candraśekhara Ācārya to return to Navadvīpa and inform everyone about His departure for the forest to search for Kṛṣṇa. When Śrī Śacīdevī, Śrī Advaita, and the other devotees of Navadvīpa heard from Śrī Candraśekhara about the Lord's acceptance of sannyāsa and departure for the forest, they became extremely morose. They all thought that they would give up their bodies because of being unable to tolerate separation from the Lord. At that time a voice from the sky informed them that within a few days the Lord would return to enjoy pastimes with them like before. Meanwhile, Gaurasundara along with Nityānanda, Gadādhara, Mukunda, and Keśava Bhāratī began to walk towards the west, and the Lord freely distributed His mercy in the form of the mellows of devotional service to Kṛṣṇa to those who followed behind Him. As the Lord entered Rāḍha-deśa and saw the natural beauty of that place and the cows grazing in the fields, He immediately remembered the pastimes of His previous incarnation and began to loudly chant the name of Hari and dance in ecstasy. Mahāprabhu then expressed a desire to perform the pastime of solitary worship in the secluded place where Vakreśvara Śiva resides. One night just before dawn, as Gaurasundara was displaying His pastime of taking rest after accepting His meal with the devotees in the house of one pious brāhmaṇa, the Lord suddenly left the devotees behind and secretly went to a field outside the village and began to cry loudly in separation from Kṛṣṇa. The devotees followed the sound of the Lord's crying and thereby located Him. While Mahāprabhu danced in ecstatic love as He listened to Mukunda's kīrtana and proceeded towards the west, He suddenly changed direction and proceeded towards the east. The Lord thus began to walk towards the Ganges. On seeing that the provinces He passed through were devoid of devotional service and afflicted by a severe famine of kṛṣṇa-kīrtana, the Lord became so distressed that He resolved to give up His life. At that time the Lord suddenly heard the chanting of the name of Hari from the mouth of a fortunate cowherd boy and concluded that the chanting of the holy name of Hari was still current at that place because of the glories of the great devotee Gaṅgā, who emanated from Lord Viṣṇu's lotus feet. In the association of Nityānanda, Śrī Mahāprabhu displayed the pastime of taking bath and offering various prayers in glorification of the Ganges. That night the Lord and Nityānanda stayed at the house of one fortunate person. On the next day all the devotees came and joined the Lord. The Lord then departed with His devotees for Nīlācala.\n\nMahāprabhu sent Nityānanda to solace the devotee residents of Navadvīpa, and He instructed Nityānanda to inform everyone that He had decided to go see the Lord of Nīlācala and would wait for them at the house of Advaita. After instructing Nityānanda to bring all the devotees to Śāntipura, Mahāprabhu went to Phuliyā, the place of Ṭhākura Haridāsa. Meanwhile, Nityānanda went to the house of Jagannātha Miśra in Māyāpur and explained everything in detail and variously solaced Śrī Śacīdevī, who had been fasting for twelve days, who was afflicted with feelings of separation, and who was nondifferent from Mother Yaśodā. On hearing the news about Mahāprabhu, all the residents of Navadvīpa including children, old people, women, fit, and unfit people became overwhelmed with eagerness to see the Lord and immediately started for Phuliyā. Those atheistic people who previously committed offenses at the feet of Mahāprabhu began to repent as they remembered their past offenses. Soon the entire village of Phuliyā became filled with a vast crowd of people. Everyone became greatly satisfied by seeing Mahāprabhu. When Mahāprabhu left Phuliyā and came to the house of Advaita Ācārya in Śāntipura, Advaita Ācārya Prabhu lost conscious in ecstasy. Then Acyutānanda, the son of Advaita, came and fell at the feet of Gaurāṅga, and the Lord picked him up and placed him on His lap. The child Acyutānanda then spoke a wonderful, conclusive statement. Meanwhile, Śrīvāsa and other devotees from Nadia came with Nityānanda to meet the Lord at Śāntipura. In the Lord's grand festival of chanting and dancing at the house of Advaita, various newer and newer transformations of ecstatic love manifested. Climbing on the throne of Lord Viṣṇu, Mahāprabhu began to personally reveal His own glories. Then, after pacifying all the devotees, winding up His pastimes of opulence, and regaining His external consciousness, the Lord repeated His Vṛndāvana pastimes by engaging with the devotees in various pastimes like taking bath and eating meals.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 1.001\n\nTEXT 1\n\navatīrṇau sa-kāruṇyau   paricchinnau sad-īśvarauśrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-nityānandau   dvau bhrātarau bhaje\n\nI worship the two brothers, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya and Śrī Nityānanda, who have descended in this world as the supreme controllers.

Since He directs everyone's consciousness towards Śrī Kṛṣṇa, He is renowned as “Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya.” His tad-ekātmā manifestations are known as Nārāyaṇa and Viṣṇu. These manifestations are included in the svayam-rūpa, therefore Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya's position as the husband of Lakṣmī is not incompatible with His pastimes in the renounced order of life.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 1.004\n\nTEXT 4\n\njaya jaya vaikuṇṭha-īśvara nyāsi-rājajaya jaya jaya bhakata-samāja\n\nAll glories to the Lord of Vaikuṇṭha and king of sannyāsīs!

Those Māyāvādīs who imagine that the Absolute Truth is impersonal can only pretend to worship Rudra, who is Lord Viṣṇu's form for destroying this temporary material world. They are misdirected by the pretension of externally taking shelter of a personal form of the Absolute Truth while internally maintaining the desire for liberation. Mahāprabhu's pretentious approval of the impersonal conception maintained by the hard-hearted residents of Rāḍha-deśa and His desire to abandon it should be seen only through devotional vision.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 1.096\n\nTEXT 96\n\ngaṅgā-mukha haiyā calilā gauracandraniravadhi dehe nija-premera ānanda\n\nAs Gauracandra headed towards the Ganges, His body was constantly filled with His own ecstatic love.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 1.097\n\nTEXT 97\n\nbhakti-śūnya sarva deśa, nā jāne kīrtanakāro mukhe nāhi kṛṣṇa-nāma-uccāraṇa\n\nAll those places were devoid of devotional service.

Śrī Acyutānanda probably took birth in 1426 Śakābda (A.D. 1504). This child said to Mahāprabhu, “You are the friend of all living entities. The Vedic scriptures, however, have established that You are the source of everything.” In this way, Śrī Acyutānanda established Śrī Caitanya as the object of the two Vedic statements: dvā suparṇā and yato vā imāni [The Taittirīya Upaniṣad (3.1.1) declares: yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante. “The Supreme Absolute Truth is that from which everything is born.].\n\nIn both the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad (3.1.1) and in the Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad (4.6) it is stated:\n\ndvā suparṇā sayujā sakhāyāsamānaṁ vṛkṣaṁ pariṣasvajāte\n\ntayor anyaḥ pippalaṁ svādv attyanaśnann anyo 'bhicākaśīti\n\n“Two companion birds sit together in the shelter of the same pippala tree. One of them is relishing the taste of the tree's berries, while the other refrains from eating and instead watches over His friend.” In the Gopāla-tāpanī Upaniṣad (1.18) it is stated: dvau suparṇau bhavato brahmaṇo 'ṁśa-bhūtas tathetaro bhoktā bhavati—“There are two birds. One of them is part and parcel of the Supreme Brahman and is subordinate to Him. He enjoys the fruits, while the other bird simply witnesses.” In the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (11.11.6) it is stated:\n\nsuparṇāv etau sadṛśau sakhāyauyadṛcchayaitau kṛta-nīḍau ca vṛkṣe\n\nekas tayoḥ khādati pippalānnamanyo niranno 'pi balena bhūyān\n\n“By chance, two birds have made a nest together in the same tree. The two birds are friends and are of a similar nature. One of them, however, is eating the fruits of the tree, whereas the other, who does not eat the fruits, is in a superior position due to His potency.”\n\nAlso in Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (6.4.24) it is stated:\n\nna yasya sakhyaṁ puruṣo 'vaiti sakhyuḥsakhā vasan saṁvasataḥ pure 'sminguṇo yathā guṇino vyakta-dṛṣṭestasmai maheśāya namaskaromi\n\n“As the sense objects [form, taste, touch, smell, and sound] cannot understand how the senses perceive them, so the conditioned soul, although residing in his body along with the Supersoul, cannot understand how the supreme spiritual person, the master of the material creation, directs his senses.

Yet before the strong will of the independent Lord, the devotees headed by Śrī Advaita relented. Just before the commencement of His journey the Lord solaced His devotees, who were afflicted by thoughts of separation, by instructing them to worship Kṛṣṇa. Gaurasundara's devotees felt pangs of separation similar to the pangs of separation felt by the residents of Vraja when Kṛṣṇa left for Mathurā, for they were nondifferent from the residents of Vraja and Gaurasundara was nondifferent from the son of Nanda. Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, Gadādhara, Mukunda, Govinda, Jagadānanda, and Brahmānanda accompanied the Lord. On the way, the Lord asked the devotees if they had any accumulated possessions with them and thereby tested their qualities of indifference and freedom from desires for material opulences. He was very pleased on learning that none of them had brought any accumulated wealth. While instructing the devotees to fully depend on Kṛṣṇa, the Lord arrived at the house of Ananta Paṇḍita in the village of Āṭisārā and exhibited the pastime of accepting his hospitality. Eventually the Lord came to the holy place named Chatrabhoga and saw the Ambuliṅga-ghāṭa there. In this connection the author has described the story of Ambu-liṅga Śiva. After taking darśana and bath at Śatamukhī-gaṅgā, the Lord became absorbed in His own internal mood. Suddenly, Rāmacandra Khān, the administrator of Chatrabhoga village, came there and offered obeisances to the Lord. He was very astonished to see the Lord's intense eagerness to see Lord Jagannātha. On understanding the identity of Rāmacandra Khān, the Lord mercifully ordered him to arrange passage for Him to go to Nīlācala. Rāmacandra Khān requested the Lord and His devotees to first accept a meal at his house, and Mahāprabhu mercifully accepted his invitation. The people of Chatrabhoga thus received an opportunity to witness the transcendental ecstatic madness of the Lord. After three quarters of the night passed and Mahāprabhu regained His external consciousness, Rāmacandra Khān arranged a boat for Mahāprabhu's journey. On the boat, Gaurasundara began to display wonderful symptoms of ecstatic love. Then, on the Lord's order, Mukunda began to sing on the boat, and because of the Lord's dancing the boat came on the verge of capsizing. When the boatman forbade them from performing kīrtana by informing them about the danger of pirates and wild aquatics like crocodiles, Mahāprabhu assured the devotees about their safety by narrating to them topics of the infallible Sudarśana cakra, which protects the devotees.\n\nAfter entering Orissa, Mahāprabhu took bath at a place known as Gaṅgā-ghāṭa and displayed the pastime of offering obeisances to Śiva, the King of Vaiṣṇavas, installed there by Yudhiṣṭhira. Leaving the devotees in a temple, the Lord went alone to the householders' houses and displayed the pastime of begging alms by spreading the end of His cloth. Jagadānanda Paṇḍita cooked whatever foodstuffs the Lord collected by begging. After taking His meal with the devotees, the Lord spent that night performing saṅkīrtana in that village. Early the next morning the Lord again started towards Purī. On the way, a road tax collector obstructed the Lord's path and demanded tax from Him. When he subsequently observed the Lord's uncommon effulgence, he allowed the Lord to pass but asked the devotees to pay tax. Later, on seeing Mahāprabhu's pastime of simultaneous indifference and affection for the devotees, the tax collector became struck with wonder and fell at the Lord's feet, begging forgiveness. After forgiving the tax collector, the Lord gradually came to the Suvarṇarekhā River and therein took bath with the devotees. As Mahāprabhu proceeded on, the devotees headed by Avadhūta Nityānanda and Jagadānanda fell far behind the Lord. During the journey Jagadānanda had been carrying the Lord's sannyāsa daṇḍa. When Jagadānanda left that daṇḍa with Nityānanda and went out to beg alms, Nityānanda took the daṇḍa in His hand and began to think that it could never be fair that the same Lord whom He carries in His heart would carry a daṇḍa. Thinking in this way Śrī Nityānanda broke the Lord's daṇḍa into three pieces. This daṇḍa-breaking pastime of Nityānanda is incomprehensible to the minds of ordinary people; only Śrī Nityānanda knows the confidential purport of this pastime. Later on, when Paṇḍita Jagadānanda approached the Lord with the pieces of the broken daṇḍa, Gaurasundara displayed the pastime of becoming externally angry with Nityānanda. He then left the devotees' company and proceeded alone to the place of Jaleśvara Śiva. Śrī Gaurasundara, who is the supreme teacher of all, then manifested His pastime of ecstatic chanting and dancing before Śiva, who is the topmost Vaiṣṇava. Meanwhile, Śrī Nityānanda and the devotees who had been left behind arrived there, and the Lord embraced them with ecstasy, discussed with them various topics, and then narrated the glories of Nityānanda.\n\nAfter spending that night in Jaleśvara, the next morning on the way to Bāṅsadaha Mahāprabhu enacted the pastime of conversing with a tāntrika-sannyāsī. He then came to the village of Remuṇā, where He chanted and danced before Gopīnātha in the association of the devotees. Thereafter the Lord came to Yājapura, and after displaying the pastime of taking bath with the devotees in the river Vaitaraṇī, the Lord suddenly left everyone behind and went somewhere and then again came before their sight. In this way the Lord gradually came to Cuttack, and after taking darśana of Sākṣi-gopāla, He went to Bhuvaneśvara. In this regard the author elaborately describes the topics of Bhuvaneśvara Śiva mentioned in the Skanda Purāṇa. He also describes the glories of the place called Ekāmraka, the meaning behind the name Bhuvaneśvara, the glories of Purī, and the topics of Śiva's position as the protector of the Lord's abodes. When Mahāprabhu arrived there, He danced jubilantly before Bhuvaneśvara Śiva. From there, the Lord went to Kamalapura. On seeing the flag on top of the Jagannātha temple, the Lord became overwhelmed with ecstasy. When Mahāprabhu came to Āṭhāranālā He expressed a desire to go see Lord Jagannātha alone. With intense eagerness He then went ahead alone and entered the temple of Jagannātha. On seeing Jagannātha and meeting the Lord after a long separation, Mahāprabhu became so absorbed in ecstasy that as He was about to embrace Jagannātha He fell unconscious to the ground. At that time Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was in the temple taking darśana of Lord Jagannātha. On seeing the condition of the new sannyāsī, he understood according to the symptoms described in the scriptures that the Lord was an exalted personality. When the temple guards were about to beat the Lord, Sārvabhauma forbade them from doing so and brought Mahāprabhu to his own house. By and by, the devotees headed by Nityānanda arrived there. After the Lord regained His external consciousness, He resolved to see Lord Jagannātha only from behind the Garuḍa pillar. Then, after taking bath, the Lord displayed the pastime of honoring mahā-prasāda with the devotees at the house of Sārvabhauma.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.001\n\nTEXT 1\n\njaya jaya gauracandra jaya sarva-prāṇajaya duṣṭa-bhayaṅkara jaya śiṣṭa-trāṇa\n\nAll glories to Gauracandra!

He is the fierce Yamarāja for the miscreants who are envious of Hari, Guru, and Vaiṣṇava. For sober devotees like Prahlāda, He is the deliverer from aversion to devotional service. After accepting the renounced order of life, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanyadeva did not accept that the living entities are one with Brahman or that this material world is false. The Māyāvādīs, who do not discriminate between sinful and sober persons, and the fruitive workers, who do discriminate, are both enthusiastic for material activities born of the three modes of nature, but since Śrī Gaurasundara did not approve of such conceptions of the materialists, karmīs, jñānīs, and yogīs, He exhibited the pastime of preaching pure devotional service and distributing ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.002\n\nTEXT 2\n\njaya śeṣa ramā aja bhavera īśvarajaya kṛpā-sindhu dīnabandhu nyāsi-vara\n\nAll glories to the Lord of Ananta Śeṣa, Lakṣmī, Brahmā, and Śiva!

So that no one would consider that Mahāprabhu was not the preacher of a mahā-bhāgavata's pastimes by considering Him an ordinary karmī- or jñānī-sannyāsī, who are both forced to enjoy the fruits of their karma, Mahāprabhu was the only friend of the karmīs, jñānīs, materialists, and fallen souls; He was the friend of the devotees; He was most merciful; He was the Lord of all; and He was svayam-rūpa Kṛṣṇa. Since He enacted the pastime of giving up all the misconceptions of the materialists, karmīs, jñānīs, and pseudo devotees, He is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. To reveal that all manifestations are exhibitions of His acintya-bhedābheda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, accepted the dress of the best of the mahā-bhāgavata sannyāsīs. Rather than attributing the spirit of worldly enjoyment on the Supreme Lord and accepting the human beings as God, the Supreme Lord remained aloof from the conceptions of material time, place, and circumstance in the course of adventing in this world, in India, in Bengal, in Nadia to teach the conclusion of acintya-bhedābheda philosophy and to enact the pastime of awarding living entities the ultimate goal of life.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.003\n\nTEXT 3\n\nbhakta-goṣṭhi-sahita gaurāṅga jaya jayakṛpā kara prabhu, yena toṅhe mana raya\n\nAll glories to Gaurāṅga along with His devotees!

As a result, they end up either knowingly or unknowingly becoming envious of Hari and Guru. Some of them dedicate themselves to karma-kāṇḍa, and because of desiring material enjoyment some consider sense gratification and liberation their ultimate goal of life. But they cannot understand that by the will of Śrī Kṛṣṇacandra, the Guru and Vaiṣṇavas are able to destroy their narrow-mindedness. The Guru and Vaiṣṇavas are full of Kṛṣṇa's potencies. There is no difference between the energy and the energetic. Yet the energy can never be identified as the energetic. This is the difference between the philosophies of the impersonalists and the devotees of the Lord. Philosophies like viśiṣṭādvaita (specific monism), śuddha-dvaita (purified dualism), and śuddhādvaita (purified monism) have manifested from portions of the philosophy of acintya-bhedābheda (inconceivable oneness and difference). Topics of the complete understanding have, in the course of narrating Śrī Caitanya's pastimes, been clearly revealed to service-inclined persons by Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, the most respectable staunch follower of Śrī Rūpa, in the verse vande gurūn īśa [vande gurūn īśa-bhaktān   īśam īśāvatārakān, tat-prakāśāṁś ca tac-chaktīḥ   kṛṣṇa-caitanya-saṁjñakam, “I offer my respectful obeisances unto the spiritual masters, the devotees of the Lord, the Lord's incarnations, His plenary portions, His energies and the primeval Lord Himself, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya.] and in his descriptions of the Pañca-tattva. People who are offenders at the feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇadāsa and who do not understand the purport of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam are either gross materialists or Māyāvādīs. The Māyāvādīs cannot understand the eternal position of the Lord's variegated energies because of their conception of oneness. In the course of their worship of many gods, the karmīs fall into hellish conditions by ascribing differences between Kṛṣṇa and Guru-Vaiṣṇavas.\n\nIn the Nārada-pañcarātra (1.14.4) Śrī Mahādeva says:\n\nrakṣitā yasya bhagavān   kalyāṇaṁ tasya santatamsa yasya vighna-kartā ca   rakṣituṁ taṁ ca kaḥ kṣamaḥ\n\n“A person who is protected by the Supreme Lord becomes victorious everywhere, and one who is rejected by the Supreme Lord can never be protected by anyone.”\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.034\n\nTEXT 34\n\nhena-mate śrī-gaurasundara nīlācaleāisena caliyā āpana-kutūhale\n\nIn this way Śrī Gaurasundara departed for Nīlācala in His own joyful mood.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.035\n\nTEXT 35\n\nnityānanda, gadādhara, mukunda, govindasaṁhati jagadānanda, āra brahmānanda\n\nThe Lord was accompanied by Nityānanda, Gadādhara, Mukunda, Govinda, Jagadānanda, and Brahmānanda.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.036\n\nTEXT 36\n\npathe prabhu parīkṣā karena sabā'-prati“ki sambala āche bala kāhāra saṁhati\n\nOn the way the Lord tested everyone by asking, “What assets do you have with you?\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.037\n\nTEXT 37\n\nke vā ki diyāche kāre pathera sambalaniṣkapaṭe mora sthāne kaha ta' sakala”\n\n“All of you tell Me frankly whether anyone has given anything to you for the journey.”\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.038\n\nTEXT 38\n\nsabe bale,—“prabhu, vinā ājñāya tomārakāra dravya laite vāśakti āche kāra”\n\nThey replied, “O Lord, who has the power to bring anything without Your permission?”\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.039\n\nTEXT 39\n\nśuniyā ṭhākura baḍa santoṣa hailāśeṣe sei lakṣye tattva kahite lāgilā\n\nOn hearing their reply, the Lord was greatly satisfied.

Since pseudo devotees who deviate from the path of devotional service imagine a distinction between Guru-Vaiṣṇava and the Supreme Lord, they cannot understand the concept of oneness. The philosophy of acintya-bhedābheda is the only cause for the nourishment of transcendental mellows. The distinction or variegatedness found in spiritual rasa is eternal and is not opposed to the Vedic statement: ekam evādvitīyam—“The Absolute Truth is one without a second.” Those who claim “according to the statement ekam evādvitīyam there are no differences born of variegatedness or distinctions in the Absolute Truth” are Māyāvādīs. As soon as the distinction between viṣaya (the object of worship) and āśraya (the worshiper) is denied, the philosophy of impersonalism becomes manifest. Because of a lack of knowledge regarding the distinctions between viṣaya and āśraya, unauthorized conclusions and degradation into material enjoyment are achieved, as prominently found among the Buddhists and sahajiyās.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.041\n\nTEXT 41\n\nbhoktavya adṛṣṭe thāke ye-dine likhanaaraṇye o āsi' mile avaśya takhana\n\n“If you are destined to receive some eatables, you will certainly obtain them, even if you are in the forest.\n\nIn the Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa (7.74) it is stated:\n\naprarthitani duḥkhānitathaiva ayaṁ hi dehināṁsukhāni api tathā manyedaivam atrātiricyate\n\n“Distress comes to embodied souls without asking, similarly happiness will also come by the arrangement of providence.”\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.042\n\nTEXT 42\n\nprabhu yāre ye-divasa nā likhe āhārarāja-putra hau tabu upavāsa tāra\n\n“If the Supreme Lord does not set aside food for a person, he will not eat, even if he is the son of a king.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.043\n\nTEXT 43\n\nthākile o khāite nā pāre ājñā-vineakasmāt kalaha karaye kāro sane\n\n“Without the Lord's sanction one may not be able to eat even if there is food, for he may suddenly quarrel with someone.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.044\n\nTEXT 44\n\nkrodha kari' bale,—“muñi nā khāimu bhāta'divya kari' rahe nija śire diye hāta\n\n“In an angry mood, he may say, `I will not eat today.'

At this place there is spot known to everyone as Ambuliṅga-ghāṭa, where there is a Śiva-liṅga made of water.\n\nChatrabhoga is situated in the 41st subdivision of the district of 24-Parganas. It is situated in the police jurisdiction of Mathurāpura. It is four and a half miles from the Mathurāpura Road railway station, which is on the East Bengal railway line. There is a huge temple of Tripurāsundarī Mahāmāyā there. The Ambuliṅga-ghāṭa is about one and a half miles from the temple of Tripurāsundarī. The present name of Ambuliṅga-ghāṭa is Baḍāsī-grāma. It is situated in the 43rd subdivision within the police jurisdiction of Mathurāpura. When Mahāprabhu visited this place, the Ganges flowed in a hundred streams on the eastern side of Baḍāsī-grāma. Although at present the hundred streams of the Ganges are not seen, there are still some signs like deep ravines there. The temple of Ambu-liṅga is still found there. When we inquired from the local people, we learned that the temple and its properties were managed by Mahānta Śrīyukta Satish Giri of Tārakeśvara, but as a result of litigation they have been transferred to one Śrīyukta Varadā Prasāda Rāya Chaudhurī, a landlord of Kāśī-nagara.\n\nWithin the temple is situated Ambu-liṅga Śiva. There is one piece of stone in the temple that resembles a Gaurī-paṭṭa [the base that supports a Śiva-liṅga]. In the middle of that stone there is a hole filled with water. The Ambu-liṅga is situated within that water. On the forehead of that liṅga there is a silver half-moon. Above this liṅga there are Deities of Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa and Gopāla. The site known as Cakra-tīrtha is situated nearly one mile southeast of Ambu-liṅga. Local people say that the Ganges flowed through that place long ago. At present one can see a pond as the remnant of the Ganges. There is a Deity of Viṣṇu there known as Mādhava. During the local festival, people first take bath in that pond and then worship the Lord at Cakra-tīrtha. In the month of May, 1930, we, along with many other Vaiṣṇavas, visited Chatrabhoga to select a place to establish the footprints of Śrī Śrī Caitanya. For an elaborate description of this, one should read Gauḍīya magazine, 8th year, number 42.\n\nNow a temple of Śrī Gaura's lotus feet has been established at this place by the joint endeavor of the President and devotees of Śrī Caitanya Maṭha, Māyāpur, the birthplace of Śrī Gaura.\n\nThe site of Ambu-liṅga is currently owned by Śrīyukta Varadākānta Prasāda Rāya Chaudhurī.

Karmīs opposed to devotional service think that Śrī Gaurasundara took His meal at the house of a pseudo brāhmaṇa who proudly identified himself as a born brāhmaṇa, but actually this pastime was meant to refute their mundane conceptions. Such blatant indirect approval of foolish behavior was simply to deceive those so-called brāhmaṇas who are attached to karma-kāṇḍa, who are worthy of being deceived, and who are perpetually bereft of spiritual understanding. Realizing that such indirect approval would in the future benefit people attached to karma-kāṇḍa, the Lord attempted to please those karmīs who are opposed to spiritual values. That way in the future they may also become Vaiṣṇavas and achieve auspiciousness by becoming dear to the Lord. Mahāprabhu never displayed any pastime of accepting anything other than kṛṣṇa-prasāda. He personally displayed the pastime of chanting one hundred thousand names of Kṛṣṇa, and He would first offer any food cooked by a so-called brāhmaṇa to Kṛṣṇa and then honor it. The Lord enacted this pastime of accepting the non-Vaiṣṇava behavior of smārtas to protect the community of so-called brāhmaṇas who would perpetually fall into hell by considering Him as one who disrespects so-called brāhmaṇas. Actually Mahāprabhu demonstrated the spiritual principle that Lord Kṛṣṇa never accepts anything offered by a person who does not chant one hundred thousand names. Exalted devotees daily chant one hundred thousand names and do not accept anything other than the remnants of Hari, Guru, and Vaiṣṇava. Therefore the remnants of mahā-prasāda that has been relished by devotees are certainly spiritual foodstuffs.

As a result of the impersonal conceptions found in pañcopāsanā (the process of worshiping the five deities Viṣṇu, Śiva, Durgā, Gaṇeśa, and Sūrya), the acceptance of human beings as God has gradually developed in Kali-yuga. But svayam-rūpa Kṛṣṇacandra manifested His own Śrī Caitanya pastimes to distribute love for Kṛṣṇa to all living entities. The attempt to accept as God human beings who imitate Śrī Caitanya is an act of foolishness. Svayam-rūpa Kṛṣṇacandra does not give those whose hearts are polluted the power to realize His Gaura pastimes, which are meant for instructing all.

By personally begging from door to door and having His devotees beg from door to door, Śrī Gaurasundara displayed the pastime of maintaining His followers, or serving the Vaiṣṇavas. Although when envious people see many persons give donations to the Gauḍīya Maṭha devotees who collect alms, they create problems for those devotees, the devotees do not hesitate to boldly preach, “Only the Gauḍīya Maṭha can constantly protect the religious principles for attaining love of God that were preached by Śrī Gaurasundara.” [By the nature of the disciplic succession, this ability is passed down to those who are qualified.] One atheistic offender has openly admitted, “The Śrī Gauḍīya Maṭha process of preaching in various countries is the path inaugurated by Śrī Gaurasundara. Actually, Śrī Gauḍīya Maṭha has become successful in the activities of properly preaching the teachings of Śrī Gaurasundara.” Even the atheistic, blasphemous sahajiyās cannot deny this fact. Although the servants of Gauḍīya Maṭha do not approve of the artificial Vaiṣṇava behavior of prākṛta-sahajiyās, and although the sahajiyās always try to oppose such servants, the sahajiyās openly admit that the preachers of Gauḍīya Maṭha follow in the footsteps of Mahāprabhu by desiring the benefit of all living entities. Just as Śrī Gaurasundara acted as the maintainer of the devotees by nourishing their spiritual lives and removing their obstacles, His servants also do the same for His service.

Since none of them had anything even to pay toll taxes, they considered they were traveling under the protection of Śrī Gaurasundara. Then one toll collector even demanded toll tax from Gaurasundara just as Hariscandra had demanded cremation fees for his own son. He firmly declared that no one would be allowed to continue the journey to Jagannātha without paying the toll tax. But when he saw Mahāprabhu's extraordinary form, he asked, “How many people are with You?” In reply, the Lord said, “I have taken sannyāsa from relationships with the people of this world. Therefore no one of this world is Mine, and I am not one of them. I am, ekam evādvitīyam—`One without a second.'

That is why Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī Prabhu has quoted in his Upadeśāmṛta the verse from the Haṁsa-gīti section of the ancient literature Mahābhārata, beginning vāco vegaṁ [vāco vegaṁ manasaḥ krodha-vegaṁjihvā-vegam udaropastha-vegam, etān vegān yo viṣaheta dhīraḥsarvām apīmāṁ pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt, “A sober person who can tolerate the urge to speak, the mind's demands, the actions of anger and the urges of the tongue, belly and genitals is qualified to make disciples all over the world.], which provides confirmation and qualification for accepting tridaṇḍa sannyāsa and which declares that every tridaṇḍa sannyāsī is expected to follow in the footsteps of Śrī Rūpa. Apyaya Dīkṣita has presented the covered-Buddhist Māyāvādīs' strong protest against the acceptance of tridaṇḍa sannyāsa in his commentary known as Parimala. Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu transformed Śrī Gaurasundara's ekadaṇḍa into tridaṇḍa to display the irrelevance of the Māyāvādī Apyaya Dīkṣita's future writing against devotional service in his books Nyāya-rakṣā-maṇi and Śivārka-maṇi-dīpikā. Śrī Baladeva Prabhu transformed the ekadaṇḍa of the sannyāsī-dressed Śrī Caitanyadeva into a tridaṇḍa to reveal that the impersonalists' acceptance of ekadaṇḍa, which is the symbol of Māyāvāda, and the current and former practices of accepting sannyāsa in the śuddha-dvaita (purified dualism) disciplic succession are not approved by the Madhva-Gauḍīya-sampradāya. This is fully approved by the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, and it is the conviction of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas. Without becoming a tridaṇḍī, no one can control himself. In the principle of tridaṇḍa found in karma-kāṇḍa, the indra-daṇḍa, vajra-daṇḍa, and brahma-daṇḍa are combined with the jīva-daṇḍa. In his explanation on tridaṇḍa, Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī Prabhu has revealed to the transcendental tridaṇḍīs the topics of controlling one's body, mind, and speech. When tridaṇḍa is combined with jīva-daṇḍa, then according to the external conception of tridaṇḍa, ekadaṇḍa becomes the principle of paramahaṁsa-dharma. But since in the principle of ekadaṇḍa, the transcendental state beyond the three modes of nature attributes faults in the process described in the Pañcarātras, ekadaṇḍa in the form of tridaṇḍa has been accepted in the process described in the Pañcarātras. This system is directly and indirectly followed in the Brahma-sampradāya, in the Brahma-Madhva-sampradāya, and in the Brahma-Madhva-Gauḍīya-sampradāya.\n\nTherefore the teachings of Śrī Gaura-Nityānanda cannot be different from those of the Śrī Brahma-Madhva-Gauḍīya-sampradāya. From this time on, persons under the shelter of Śrī Caitanyadeva have become known as Gauḍīya tridaṇḍi-svāmīs. Śrī Prabodhānanda Sarasvatīpada's acceptance of sannyāsa on the path of regulative principles and the Śrī Rūpānuga's acceptance of sannyāsa on the path of paramahaṁsa did not create any mutual contradiction. Although the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas accept sannyāsa on the path of regulative principles, they are not opposed to the paramahaṁsa-dharma of the followers of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Sanātana. Although in paramahaṁsa-dharma the symbols found in the regulative path are considered external, acceptance of external symptoms does not violate the principles of the paramahaṁsas. Although the five other Vrajavāsī Gosvāmīs followed the footsteps of Śrī Sanātana in accepting the dress of paramahaṁsas, Śrī Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī Gosvāmī accepted tridaṇḍa sannyāsa on the path of regulative principles and recorded the Gauḍīya doctrine in his book Śrī Caitanya-candrāmṛta. The recent pure devotional endeavors by the followers of Śrī Rūpa to rectify the behavior of the fallen, deviant, so-called paramahaṁsas, to protect the proper code of conduct, and to inaugurate the path of regulative principles for the purpose of counteracting the attack on those who traverse the path of anurāga, or loving attachment, have become the object of ignorant people's opposition and neglect. Because of transgressing the etiquette of respecting the Lord's manifestations, there have been many obstacles in the worship of the Absolute Truth in every yuga. Those who do not understand the purport of the path of regulative principles consider the inauspiciousness resulting from transgressing that path as progress on that path. Moreover, by respecting only the path of regulative principles, the more elevated path becomes closed. Śrīla Prabodhānanda Tridaṇḍipāda was not opposed to the Six Gosvāmīs of Vṛndāvana. But the shortsighted, so-called followers of the Gosvāmīs accepted the conception of Śrī Prabodhānanda as conflicting. As a result, the followers of such people ended up spreading communal dispute.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.209\n\nTEXT 209\n\nīśvarera icchā-mātra īśvara se jānekena bhāṅgilena daṇḍa, jāniba kemane\n\nOnly the Supreme Lord knows the will of the Supreme Lord.

The most worshipable Śrī Gaurasundara is svayam-rūpa, and Śrī Nityānanda, the topmost devotee, is svayam-prakāśa. By following only the path of regulative principles, the worship of Gaurasundara is hindered. And also by transgressing Śrī Nityānanda, the service of Śrī Gaurasundara is hindered. Śrī Nityānanda assists in Śrī Gaurasundara's preaching of ecstatic love of God in ten different forms. Only Śrī Nityānanda is able to reveal to the world the mystery of Śrī Caitanya's acceptance of ekadaṇḍa and, in the position of being without daṇḍa, His acceptance of tridaṇḍa. The Śrīmad Bhāgavatam has prescribed for the devotees of Viṣṇu the process of accepting tridaṇḍa. Only the tridaṇḍīs are able to actually attain the stage of paramahaṁsa, whereas ekadaṇḍīs preaching the mundane concept of impersonalism cannot understand their own position. Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu alone is able to reveal many of the favorable items of spiritual consideration, like the characteristics and differences found in the ekadaṇḍa, which is a combination of jīva-daṇḍa with the tridaṇḍa of the Vedic sanātana-dharma, and how oneness can be the combination of many.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.213\n\nTEXT 213\n\nbalarāma vinā anya caitanyera daṇḍabhāṅgibāre pāre hena ke āche pracaṇḍa?\n\nWho other than Balarāma is powerful enough to break Lord Caitanya's daṇḍa?\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.214\n\nTEXT 214\n\nsakala bujhāya chale śrī-gaurasundareye jānaye marma, sei jana sukhe tare\n\nŚrī Gaurasundara taught everyone by this pretext.

If You cannot forgive Me, then punish Me appropriately.”\n\nThe daṇḍa is carried by a sannyāsī who has not yet attained the platform of paramahaṁsa. Therefore everyone can understand that a sannyāsī without a daṇḍa has attained the final stage of spiritual life. Worldly opulences cannot disturb such a person. But since paramahaṁsas do not accept this symbol of renunciation, ordinary people cannot understand their exalted position. That is why foolish people consider the topmost paramahaṁsa Vaiṣṇavas to be inferior to themselves. Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu broke the bamboo daṇḍa of svayam-rūpa Vrajendra-nandana, Śrī Caitanya, so that people would not mistakenly consider anyone who simply carries a daṇḍa made of bamboo to be situated just below the topmost paramahaṁsa platform. Realizing that people would invite inauspiciousness by committing the offense of considering Lord Caitanya as simply a sannyāsī or considering that He was obligated to accept such symbols and that they would thereby meet with obstacles in understanding that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nityānanda broke the one daṇḍa into three daṇḍas. This pastime of Śrī Nityānanda was meant to reveal that the principles of tridaṇḍa, entailing control of the body, mind, and speech, are to be respected by those whose senses are not controlled; that ekadaṇḍa is the combined form of the tridaṇḍa; and that it is the duty of paramahaṁsas to renounce the daṇḍa. The tendency of tridaṇḍīs is to neither aspire for anyone's blessing nor to award anyone worldly blessings. Those who are bound by mundane conceptions have little interest in pursuing spiritual life. If such people relegate Śrī Gaurasundara to relative roles like daṇḍena-daṇḍī, or a sannyāsī because of carrying a daṇḍa, they will achieve inauspiciousness.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.225\n\nTEXT 225\n\nprabhu bale,—“yāhe sarva-deva-adhiṣṭhānase tomāra mate ki haila vāṁśa-khāna!”\n\nThe Lord said, “All the demigods reside in the daṇḍa, and You call it a piece of bamboo!”\n\nAccording to spiritual consideration one should respect the supremely pure tridaṇḍa, which is a worshipable form of the three guṇa-avatāras. But since the mundane consideration that the Deity form of Viṣṇu is made of stone leads one to hell, Śrī Nityānanda delivered all living entities from future offense.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.226\n\nTEXT 226\n\nke bujhite pāre gaurasundarera līlā?mane kare eka, mukhe kare āra khelā\n\nWho can understand the pastimes of Śrī Gaurasundara?

Śrī Rāmānuja preached unalloyed Vaiṣṇava-dharma four hundred years before the advent of Śrī Caitanya. Those who synthesize matter and spirit try hard to equate the guṇa-avatāras with Vāsudeva Viṣṇu. As a result, they commit offenses at the feet of the Supreme Lord. To release such people from their offenses, Śrī Lakṣmaṇa-deśika vigorously and single-handedly preached the topics of devotional service to Viṣṇu. Veteran Vaiṣṇavas headed by Śrī Anandatīrtha worshiped the guṇa-avatāras Brahmā and Śiva as devotees of the Supreme Lord. Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya visited the temple of Śiva, the incarnation of a devotee, and prayed for devotional service to Kṛṣṇa. But if Mahādeva, the best of the devotees, is disrespected on the basis of the unalloyed principles of Śrī Rāmānuja by those who are subservient to Śrī Caitanya, then because of exhibiting envy of a devotee, pure devotees headed by the author become angry at such envious people. They disrespect Lord Śiva's position as the supreme Vaisnava, which is substantiated as follows: śiva-viriñci-nutaṁśaraṇyam—“The Supreme Lord is honored by powerful demigods like Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā;”dāsāste hara-nārada-prabhṛtayaḥ—“Personalities like Śiva and Nārada are His servants;” vaiṣṇavānāṁ yathāśambhuḥ—“Śambhu, Lord Śiva, is the greatest of all devotees of Lord Viṣṇu;” Śiva is the best among the twelve Vaiṣṇava authorities; and he is the original spiritual master of the Viṣṇusvāmī-sampradāya. Furthermore, those people think that since the Liṅgayet community or the worshipers of Śiva unnecessarily attack Vaiṣṇavas, when the Vaiṣṇavas go to see Lord Śiva at a Śiva temple where Śaivites are engaged in his worship, they have lost the association of sādhus who are svajātīyāśaya-snigdha, or “pleasing to the same class of people.” The followers of Śrī Caitanya do not think like this.\n\nIn the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (4.24.28) Lord Śiva speaks the following words:\n\nyaḥ paraṁ raṁhasaḥ sākṣāttri-guṇāj jīva-saṁjñitātbhagavantaṁ vāsudevaṁprapannaḥ sa priyo hi me\n\n“Any person who is surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, the controller of everything—material nature as well as the living entity—is actually very dear to me.”\n\nAnd in the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (4.4.13-14) Satī speaks as follows:\n\nnāścaryam etad yad asatsu sarvadāmahad-vinindā kuṇapātma-vādiṣuserṣyaṁ mahāpūruṣa-pāda-pāṁsubhirnirasta-tejaḥsu tad eva śobhanam\n\n“It is not wonderful for persons who have accepted the transient material body as the self to engage always in deriding great souls.

Because people attached to śākta philosophy glorify their own sense gratification, they cannot understand unalloyed service to Adhokṣaja. Prākṛta-sahajiyās are fit to be addressed as “pāpīśāktas”. Their goal of life is material enjoyment. Just as Śrī Gaurasundara cheated such prākṛta-sahajiyās by approving of their activities when He met them, the most pure spiritual master of this fallen soul also recently cheated many people interested in material enjoyment by following the example set by Śrī Caitanya. People interested in material enjoyment think that the Vaiṣṇavas hanker after name and fame as they do. Such prākṛta-sahajiyās or sinful śāktas also know that when they spread their network of wicked motives to compel the Vaiṣṇavas to become attached householders by tempting them with household comforts, the most independent Vaiṣṇavas will rebuke them with angry words. The Vaiṣṇavas never visit the homes of prākṛta-sahajiyās. The most independent pure Vaiṣṇavas never participate in any gathering arranged by any prākṛta-sahajiyā. Foolish people think that the supremely liberated mahā-bhāgavatas support their sinful activities, but the actual aim of Śrī Gaurasundara and His devotees is to deceive them by remaining aloof from their bad association.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.272\n\nTEXT 272\n\nśuniyā calilāśākta hai' haraṣitaei mata īśvarera agādha carita\n\nOn hearing the Lord's reply, the śākta departed happily.

In other's opinion the name Yājapura is derived from the word yajñānuṣṭhāna (“a place of sacrifice”) or yājana (“worship”). Śrīman Mahāprabhu made His auspicious arrival in Yājapura in A.D. 1511. The temple of Śrī Varāhadeva is situated in Yājapura. Śrīman Mahāprabhu displayed the pastime of offering obeisances, chanting, and dancing before Śrī Varāhadeva. It is described in Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta (Madhya 5.3-4):\n\ncalite calite āilā yājapura-grāmavarāha-ṭhākura dekhi' karilā praṇāma\n\nnṛtya-gīta kaila preme bahuta stavanayājapure se rātri karilā yāpana\n\n“Walking and walking, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His party finally arrived at Yājapura, on the river Vaitaraṇī. There He saw the temple of Varāhadeva and offered His obeisances unto Him. In the temple of Varāhadeva, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu engaged in chanting and dancing and offered prayers. He passed that night in the temple.”\n\nIn Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta there is an indication that Mahāprabhu came to Yājapura another time. In the year when Śrīman Mahāprabhu had a disagreement with Śrīla Gadādhara Paṇḍita Gosvāmī Prabhu regarding his residing in Nīlācala as a resident sannyāsī, Śrī Gaurasundara came to Yājapura with Śrī Rāya Rāmānanda and the two Mahāpātras, Maṅgarāja and Haricandana. Mahāprabhu then bid farewell to the two Mahāpātras at Yājapura. (See Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Madhya-līlā, Chapter Sixteen, verse 150.)\n\nThe two stone Deities of Śrī Varāhadeva are attached to each other. On the left of the Deities there is a stone deity of Śrī Lakṣmī, and on her left there is a Deity of Śrī Jagannāthadeva. In front of them there is a smaller set of Lakṣmī-Varāha deities made of metal. From the Yājapura Road railway station one must take three buses and cross two rivers to travel the seventeen miles to the temple of Varāhadeva. On both banks of both rivers there are connecting buses waiting to transport passengers. After traveling nine miles in one bus, one crosses the first river called Yamunā Khāi. Then one has to walk six miles to the next river called Buḍā. After crossing this river, one catches a connecting bus. There is a dharmaśālā in Yājapura known as Rādhābāi Dharmaśālā or Jagannātha Dharmaśālā. It is situated near the ancient temple of Jagannātha. The footprints of Śrī Caitanya were established in Yājapura on December 25, 1930.

The Deity of Sākṣi-gopāla was in Cuttack during the time of Śrīman Mahāprabhu. This Deity was later transferred to a village named Sākṣi-gopāla. After the disappearance of Śrī Mahāprabhu this Deity of Sākṣi-gopāla was first brought to the temple of Jagannātha and later installed in a separate village.\n\nThis Deity has a large, four-armed form. The old story of Sākṣi-gopāla is described in Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Madhya-līlā, Chapter Five.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.304\n\nTEXT 304\n\n`prabhu', bali' namaskāra karena stavanaadbhuta karena prema-ānanda-krandana\n\nThe Lord cried out, “Prabhu!” and offered obeisances and prayers. He then began to cry wonderfully in ecstatic love.\n\nSākṣi-gopāla was previously situated in Cuttack on the bank of the Mahānadī River. When Sākṣi-gopāla was first brought from South India, He stayed for some time in Cuttack and then stayed for some time in the Jagannātha temple in Puruṣottama. After some loving quarrel took place there, the King of Orissa established the village of Satyavādī six miles from Puruṣottama and kept Sākṣi-gopāla there. At present Śrī Sākṣi-gopāla is being worshiped in a full-fledged temple. For a description of Sākṣi-gopāla, one should read Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Madhya-līlā, Chapter Five.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.305\n\nTEXT 305\n\nyāra mantre sakala mūrtite vaise prāṇasei prabhu—śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanyacandra nāma\n\nLife is invoked in the Deity forms of the Supreme Lord by chanting His holy names.

Without chanting the Lord's holy names, the concept that the arcā-vigraha is made of stone does not disappear. The rules and regulations for worship that Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanyadeva prescribed according to the concepts of the kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ verse consist of lively and proper worship of the Lord's Deity, based simply on chanting the mahā-mantra. Wherever the Lord's service is performed without the physical involvement of the worshiper or wherever the worship is performed as a matter of formality, such worship and such deities are devoid of life. Chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra preached by Śrī Gaurasundara is the topmost lively form of worship for a worshiper.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.306\n\nTEXT 306\n\ntathāpiha niravadhi kare dāsya-līlāavatāra haile haya ei mata khelā\n\nYet in this incarnation the Lord always relished enacting pastimes as a servant.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.307\n\nTEXT 307\n\ntabe prabhu āilena śrī-bhuvaneśvaragupta-kāśī-vāsa yathā karena śaṅkara\n\nThereafter the Lord went to Śrī Bhuvaneśvara, known also as Gupta-kāśī, where Lord Śaṅkara resides.\n\nA description of the holy place Śrī Bhuvaneśvara is found in various literatures like Svarṇādri-mahodaya, Ekāmra Purāṇa, Skanda Purāṇa, and other Sanskrit Purāṇas. In those literatures this place is addressed by various names like Bhuvaneśvara, Ekāmraka-kṣetra, Hemācala, Svarṇādri-kṣetra.\n\nBeing requested by some sages, Vyāsa Bhagavān revealed the glories of the rarely attained Ekāmraka-kṣetra. This place has been known as Ekāmraka-kṣetra because long ago there was a huge mango tree there. There are ten million Śiva-liṅgas and eight tīrthas at this place. This place is superior to Vārāṇasī and is more dear to Śambhu, the best of the Vaiṣṇavas.\n\nIn Orissa, on the shore of the southern ocean, there is a river named Gandhavatī that flows east. This river is nondifferent from the Ganges. The transcendental abode named Ekāmraka-tīrtha is situated on the bank of this most sacred river. This place is more pleasing than Kailāsa.\n\nThe length and breadth of this place are three yojanas (twenty-four miles). Eight miles of this place is worshipable to the demigods, and two miles of this place was covered by the shade of that mango tree. Since time immemorial at this place pious persons have taken bath, chanted mantras, performed sacrifices, offered oblations, performed abhiṣeka, offered worship, offered prayers, accepted prasāda garlands, heard the Purāṇas, served the lotus feet of the Lord's devotees, and executed the nine forms of devotional service.\n\nIn the Svarṇādri-mahodaya it is stated that Lord Puruṣottama is the maintainer of this place. The eternal Supreme Brahman is eternally present at this place in the form of the liṅga “Tribhuvaneśvara.” According to the statement, liṅgyate jñāyate yasmāt, the Supreme Brahman resides in the state of Orissa in the form of a liṅga within a sacred gold mountain surrounded by the demigods. Since Nārāyaṇa personally protects this place with a cakra and club in His hands, He is the kṣetra-pāla, or protector of this place.\n\nIt is further stated in the Svarṇādri-mahodaya that Lord Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva personally protects this place with a cakra and a club in His hands. Pious activities performed without first taking darśana of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva yield no results. Only those who have unflinching devotion for Lord Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva are able to attain the mercy of Śrī Bhuvaneśvara, who is very dear to Ananta Vāsudeva.\n\nWhen Bhuvaneśvarī Bhagavatī heard from the mouth of Śambhu the glories of Ekāmraka-tīrtha, which is superior to Vārāṇasī, she expressed a desire to visit that place. Śambhu then told Bhuvaneśvarī, “You first go there alone, and I will meet you there later.” Having received her husband's permission, she rode on her lion carrier and soon arrived at Svarṇādri. When she arrived there, she saw that it was indeed more pleasing than Kailāsa. She also saw a great liṅga emanating white and black effulgence. Bhuvaneśvarī began to worship that great liṅga with all ingredients. One day after Bhuvaneśvarī had gone to another forest to pick flowers, she returned and saw one thousand cows as white as jasmine flowers come out of a lake and begin to lavishly bathe that great liṅga with milk. After circumambulating the liṅga, they returned to where they had come from. When she saw the same incident on another occasion, she took the form of a cowherd girl and began to follow those cows. She passed fifteen years in this way.\n\nWhile wandering in that forest one day, two young demon brothers named Kṛtti and Vāsa became captivated by the unprecedented beauty of that cowherd girl and expressed to her their self-destructive, wicked intentions.\n\nSatī immediately disappeared from the sight of the two demons and remembered the lotus feet of Śambhu. As soon as Bhagavatī remembered Mahādeva, he immediately took the form of a cowherd boy and appeared before the cowherd-girl form of Satī. Satī, in the form of a cowherd girl, offered obeisances to Śambhu, who had taken the form of a cowherd boy. Mahādeva said, “O Satī, I understand why you remembered me. There is no need to feel anxiety. By the will of the Supreme Lord these two demons have expressed wicked intentions to you to invite their own ruination. Let me explain their history to you in detail. There was once a king named Drumila who performed many sacrifices and thereby pleased the demigods. The demigods gave him the benediction that he would have two sons named Kṛtti and Vāsa, who would not be killed by any weapons. So now, by the will of the Supreme Lord, you will have to kill those two sinful demons.”\n\nBeing ordered by her husband, Satī began to wander about within the forest in her form as a cowherd girl and within a short time she met those two demons. To deceive them, Satī said to the two demon brothers, “I can fulfill your desires, but I have a condition. I will become the wife of he who can carry me on his shoulder.”\n\nOn hearing Satī's statement, the two intoxicated brothers began to quarrel between themselves. Then Satī in her form as a cowherd girl placed her two feet on the shoulders of the two brothers and assumed the form of Viśvambharī. Who has the power to carry the heavy burden of Viśvambharī? By the weight of Satī, the two demons were crushed and destroyed. This Purāṇic incident concludes by stating that since that time Satī and Śambhu, the husband of Satī, left their golden temple in Kāśī and have been living in this Ekāmraka forest.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.308\n\nTEXT 308\n\nsarva-tīrtha-jala yathā bindu bindu āni'`bindu-sarovara' śiva sṛjilā āpani\n\nŚiva brought drops of water from all the holy places and created the lake known as Bindu-sarovara.\n\nAfter killing the two demons Kṛtti and Vāsa by crushing them under her feet, Bhuvaneśvarī in the form of a cowherd girl fell asleep with an intense thirst. To quench Bhuvaneśvarī's thirst, Mahādeva pierced a mountain with the tip of his trident and created a well. This well became renowned as Śaṅkara-vāpī, Lord Śiva's well. Yet Bhuvaneśvarī desired to drink water from a properly established reservoir. Śambhu thus sent his bull carrier to bring water from all the holy places and to invite Brahmā to establish that reservoir by performing a sacrifice. Being invited by the bull carrier, Brahmā and other demigods came to this place and offered their obeisances to Bhuvaneśvara. The bull then brought waters of the Mandākinī and other sources from heaven; he brought waters from Prayāga, Puṣkara, Gaṅgā, Gaṅgādvara, Naimiṣa, Prabhāsa, Pitṛ-tīrtha, Gaṅgā-sāgara-saṅgama, Payoṣṇī, Vipāśā, Śatadru, Kāverī, Gomatī, Kṛṣṇā, Yamunā, Sarasvatī, Gaṇḍakī, Ṛṣikulyā, Mahānadī, and other sources from earth; and he brought waters from the milk ocean and other sources from Pātāla. When Bhuvaneśvara saw all the tīrthas assembled there, he took up his trident, pierced a mountain, and said, “I have decided to create a lake at this place. All of you offer one drop of water into this lake.” After the tīrthas followed the order of Śambhu, Lord Janārdana and the demigods headed by Brahmā took bath therein. Bhuvaneśvara and his followers also happily entered into those waters. Bhuvaneśvara then said, “Now two pure reservoirs of water, Śaṅkara-vāpī and Bindu-sarovara, have been established. If one takes bath in Śaṅkara-vāpī, one will attain the same features as mine, and if one takes bath in Bindu-sarovara, one will attain my abode.”\n\nThereafter the topmost Vaiṣṇava Śambhu offered his obeisances to Janārdana and said, “O Puruṣottama, please reside with Ananta as two Deities on the eastern bank of this lake and take the positions of my controller and the protector of this abode.” Since then Lord Ananta Vāsudeva has been blessing His dear Śaṅkara by giving him His remnants and residing on the eastern bank of Bindu-sarovara as Śambhu's controller and the protector of this abode. Thus Bhuvaneśvara Śambhu is worshiped by offerings of Śrī Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva's remnants.\n\nIn the Svarṇādri-mahodaya it is stated that this Bindu-sarovara is also known by the name Maṇikarṇī, and it is the essence of all tīrthas. If a person takes darśana of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva after taking a bath in this essence of all tīrthas Maṇikarṇī, he will certainly go to Vaikuṇṭhaloka. By giving charity to brāhmaṇas and Vaiṣṇavas at this place one obtains a hundred times the fruits obtained at other holy places, and by offering oblations here to the forefathers with the remnants of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva the souls of one's forefathers obtain inexhaustible satisfaction. Taking a bath in this Bindu-sarovara is equal to taking a bath at all holy places. By taking darśana of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva after taking bath, one attains unlimited fruits.\n\nFestivals like Śrī Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva and Śrī Śrī Madana-mohana's Candana-yātrā and boat pastimes are held in this Bindu-sarovara.\n\nThe ancient temple of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva is still present today on the eastern bank of Bindu-sarovara. This temple is decorated by fine art and architecture. The Deity of Śrī Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva Viṣṇu was established in this large temple beautified by fine art and architecture by Śrī Bhavadeva Bhaṭṭa, a resident of Siddhala-grāma. Learned scholars of the Sāvarṇa dynasty were given many villages by the king. Siddhala-grāma was the best of those villages. In this village the three great souls Mahādeva, Bhavadeva (the first), and Aṭṭahāsa took birth. Of them, Bhavadeva became most prominent and popular. He received the village Hastinī from the King of Gauḍa. He had eight sons headed by Rathāṅga. The son of Rathāṅga was Atyaṅga, the son of Atyaṅga was Budha, and the son of Budha was Ādideva, who became the Gauḍa king's prime minister. Ādideva's son Govardhana married a girl from the Bandyaghaṭiya family. From her womb the second Bhavadeva took birth. This Bhavadeva was greatly learned in tantra, mathematics, astrology, and āyur-veda. Books on astrology, logic, and mīmāṁsā written by him have become well known in the society of learned scholars. On the strength of this Bhavadeva's counsel, Harivarmadeva and his son enjoyed ruling the kingdom for a long time. This Bhavadeva Bhaṭṭa established many reservoirs of water in various places of Rāḍha-deśa, which is generally bereft of water. It was he who established the Deity form of Śrī Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva Viṣṇu in a newly built temple and who had Bindu-sarovara dredged clean. He was decorated with the title Bāla-vallabhī-bhujaṅga. This information is found in the description of Bhavadeva Bhaṭṭa's dynasty engraved in stone within the Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva temple. The poet named Śrī Vācaspati, a dear friend of Bhavadeva, wrote this information in poem. This stone inscription was preserved within the temple until the middle of the nineteenth century. Thereafter Colonel Kiṭo Sāheba attached this stone inscription along with the Megheśvara inscription to the wall of the Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva temple. The dimensions of this stone inscription are two cubits, two inches long and one cubit, one inch wide (a cubit is about a foot and a half). There are twenty-five lines of inscription on the stone. Each letter measures about a half inch.\n\nIn the sixth and seventh chapters of the Svarṇādri-mahodaya, Mahādeva says, “O Brahmā, you should come with the other demigods to Ekāmraka forest and faithfully worship the ancient liṅga with various transcendental ingredients. After the completion of the worship you should faithfully honor his remnants.”\n\nAfter hearing the order of Mahādeva, Brahmā asked, “O Maheśvara, we do not know your glories. The sages say that the remnants of a liṅga should not be honored. Therefore how can we accept those remnants?”\n\nVyāsa said, “Although the remnants of a liṅga are not to be accepted, Śrī Bhuvaneśvara is not a liṅga, he is the eternal Supreme Brahman. Statements that prohibit one from honoring Śiva's remnants are not applicable to Bhuvaneśvara. The demigods honor the remnants of Bhuvaneśvara to cross the material ocean. Foodstuffs offered to Bhuvaneśvara should be honored with the understanding that they are transcendental. As far as the acceptance of Bhuvaneśvara's remnants is concerned, there should not be any discrimination whether one is a brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, or outcaste, otherwise one will certainly go to hell. On receiving Bhuvaneśvara's prasāda, one should immediately honor it. Bhuvaneśvara's prasāda is never contaminated by contact with impure living entities. One should distribute this prasāda to the demigods, forefathers, and brāhmaṇas. The result one obtains by giving charity in Kurukṣetra during the solar or lunar eclipse is attained by distributing the remnants of Bhuvaneśvara. Whether it is dry, stale, or brought from a distant place, simply by honoring Bhuvaneśvara's prasāda one is delivered from all unwanted habits. By honoring Bhuvaneśvara's prasāda one attains the result of seeing, worshiping, meditating on, or hearing about Viṣṇu. There is a possibility of taking birth again after drinking nectar, but there is no rebirth for one who honors Bhuvaneśvara's prasāda. By seeing Bhuvaneśvara's prasāda one's desires are fulfilled, by touching it to one's head one's sinful reactions are destroyed, by honoring it one counteracts the reactions of eating nonvegetarian food, by smelling it the sins committed in one's mind are destroyed, by seeing it one's vision is purified, by smearing it on one's limbs the body is purified, by eating it to one's full satisfaction one attains the result of observing an Ekādaśī without water, and by honoring it with full respect one attains the devotional service of Viṣṇu.”\n\nWhen the sages inquired further, Vyāsa said, “In the Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa, Brahmā said to Nārada, `What to speak of human beings, even the demigods headed by Brahmā accept human forms and beg for Bhuvaneśvara's remnants. There is no consideration of rules and regulations or auspicious or inauspicious times in the eating of Bhuvaneśvara's prasāda. If one accepts Bhuvaneśvara's prasāda that has been touched by a most fallen person, one attains the abode of Viṣṇu. Those who criticize Bhuvaneśvara's prasāda by comparing it to the ordinary prasāda of a Śiva-liṅga certainly go to hell. Gaurī, the greatest Vaiṣṇavī, cooks Bhuvaneśvara's offerings, and the eternal Supreme Brahman eats it. Therefore there is no consideration of any contamination in it because of contact with impure living entities. You should know that it is completely transcendental. If the remnants of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva and the mahā-mahā-prasāda of Śrī Bhuvaneśvara is touched by the mouth of a dog or brought from a place where nonvegetarian foods are kept, it is to be accepted by even the best of the brāhmaṇas. By eating the remnants of this transcendental liṅga one attains Lord Viṣṇu's shelter, which is rare for even personalities like Brahmā and Indra. Those who blaspheme persons who eat such mahā-prasāda will continue to live in hell for as long as the sun and moon shine in the sky. Whether one has taken bath or not, simply by honoring Bhuvaneśvara's mahā-prasāda one becomes purified externally and internally. With His thousand mouths even Anantadeva is unable to describe the glories of this mahā-mahā-prasāda, which is the remnants of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva's remnants. One can please Bhuvaneśvara simply by hearing the glories of this prasāda, and if Bhuvaneśvara is pleased Govinda is also pleased.'”\n\nEveryday after the completion of Śrī Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva's worship and offering, Śrī Bhuvaneśvara accepts his own worship and offering. This system is still current in Bhuvaneśvara. Apart from this, he teaches Viṣṇu's devotional service to the people of the entire world while setting the example of giving up material enjoyment for the pleasure of Kṛṣṇa by his own behavior of not riding on the chariot or going out during the Candana-yātrā or boat festival but offering these conveyances and various other enjoyable ingredients to his eternal Lords, Śrī Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva and Śrī Śrī Madana-mohana. Whenever it is mentioned that Śrī Bhuvaneśvara rides on an airplane or chariot, it is to be understood that the pleasure of Śrī Śrī Madana-mohana and Śrī Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva was the purpose of all such occasions.\n\nThe pāṇḍās (priests) of Bhuvaneśvara call Śrī Śrī Madana-mohana the pratinidhi, or “representative,” of Bhuvaneśvara. In this context the word “representative” does not mean subordinate as it is normally understood in the relationship between a king and his representative. According to the consideration of servitorship, or śakti-tattva, Śrī Bhuvaneśvara does not personally accept any items of enjoyment but offers them to his only Lord, the supremely independent Śrī Madana-mohana, who is the source of all energies and the proprietor of all enjoyable objects. In other words, because he does not independently enjoy but rather gives enjoyment to his Lord, his Lord is addressed as his “representative.” Rather than accept worship for himself, Bhuvaneśvara accepts worship on behalf of his Lords, Śrī Madana-mohana and Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva. Even if he ever does accept any service for himself, he accepts it as a servant of Śrī Madana-mohana or Śrī Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva. He does not independently accept any service.\n\nThe Deity of Śrī Madana-mohana situated in Śrī Bhuvaneśvara is not two-armed but is four-armed. On Madana-mohana's upper left hand there is an impression of a deer, on His upper right hand there is an impression of an ax, His lower left hand displays the sign of fearlessness, and His lower right hand displays the sign of awarding benediction. Śrī Madana-mohana, Śrī Govinda, a five-headed Mahādeva, Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva's vijaya-mūrti, a four-armed Harihara mūrti, and ŚrīŚālagrāma are worshiped in a temple south of the original Bhuvaneśvara temple.\n\nAmong the committee members who look after the service of the Śrī Bhuvaneśvara temple are Śrīyukta Priyanātha Caṭṭopādhyāya, a lawyer from Cuttack; Śrīyukta Gaṅgādhara Chaudhurī, a landlord from Purī district; and Śrīyukta Gopāla Prahararāja, another lawyer from Cuttack. This committee has employed a manager. The name of the present manager is Śrīyukta Lachman Rāmānuja dāsa. The manager takes care of the income and expenditure for the various services in the Bhuvaneśvara temple with the help of the four following head pāṇḍās: Jagannātha Mahāpātra, Nārāyaṇa Makadama, Dāmodara Sāntarā, and Sadaya Mahāpātra.\n\nAs a patita-pāvana mūrti is established within the lion gate of the Śrī Jagannātha temple for the benefit of fallen souls outside the varṇāśrama system, there is also a patita-pāvana mūrti within the lion gate of the Śrī Bhuvaneśvara temple. Within the lion gate there is a market known as Ānanda-bazaar. As in the Purī Ānanda-bazaar, items like prasāda are also bought and sold here. Like Jagannātha prasāda, the prasāda here is not contaminated by contact with impure living entities. After crossing the lion gate there is a Garuḍa-stambha, on the top of which a bull and Garuḍa are situated. As in the Jagannātha temple there also is a Deity of Nṛsiṁhadeva at the entrance here. This four-armed Deity of Nṛsiṁhadeva is in a peaceful mood. In His upper right hand He holds a cakra, in His upper left hand He holds a conch, and in His lower two hands He holds the Vedas. Śrī Lakṣmīdevī is sitting on His lap. South of the original temple is Bhuvaneśvara's kitchen. There is an order that the rays of the sun and moon should not fall on it. Brāhmaṇa pāṇḍās from three hundred sixty families cook here. The deity of Śrī Bhuvaneśvara within the main temple is a combined form of Śrī Hari and Hara. The pāṇḍās show everyone this Śrī Bhuvaneśvara deity, which has a black and white form. The form of Śrī Bhuvaneśvara is shaped like a cakra and has impressions of Gaṅgā, Yamunā, and Sarasvatī as well as the ten incarnations beginning with Matsya and Kūrma.\n\nThe wonderful artistic work of Bhuvaneśvara temple attracts the attention of common people who come for darśana. After seeing the artistry and architectural work of the Bhuvaneśvara temple, the Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva temple, and the many other temples in Bhuvaneśvara, one can realize how advanced Indian art was at one time. The Bhuvaneśvara temple is one hundred sixty-five feet tall. This temple is situated on a huge stone slab three hundred yards south of Bindu-sarovara. The dimensions of the temple are five hundred twenty by four hundred sixty-five feet. Apart from this, there is a twenty-eight foot exterior hall north of the temple. The main hall measures two hundred thirty-five feet. The temple walls are seven foot five inch thick. There are large gates on the four sides of the temple. The eastern gate is the largest of the four and is called the Siṁha-dvāra, or the lion gate. There are two large lions on the two sides of the entrance. Within the courtyard there is twenty-foot long, four-foot high stone slab wall. This unbreakable stone wall was built to protect the temple from outside attack. The Deity of Śrī Nṛsiṁhadeva is situated on one side of this wall. There are many small Śiva temples within the western courtyard. Among those temples there is a twenty-foot tall temple. This temple is older than the main temple. The altar of this temple is five feet below the ground level of the temple. It is said that the original Śiva-liṅga is situated here. Even after the main temple was built the original liṅga was not transferred from here. There is a temple of Bhuvaneśvarī in one corner of the western courtyard. On one side of the expansive stone slab found after one enters the Siṁha-dvāra there is a temple of Gopālinī, Satī's form as a cowherd girl. Although the ground level of the Gopālinī temple is lower than the ground level of the main temple, it is at the same level as the original liṅga. There are six stone steps west of the Gopālinī temple. Above those steps and below Bhuvaneśvara's kitchen there is a deity of Vṛṣabha, the bull carrier.\n\nThe bhoga-maṇḍapa, or hall where offerings are made, is situated directly in front of the Bhuvaneśvara temple. Behind the hall is the nātya-mandira (the hall where drama, dance, and kīrtana are performed), behind the nātya-mandira is the jagamohana (the area directly in front of the central altar), behind the jagamohana is the main temple, and within this is the garbha-gṛha, where the deity is situated. According to the conclusion of Rājā Rājendralāla Mitra, the bhoga-maṇḍapa was built during Kamala Keśarī's rule, which lasted from A.D. 792 to 811. But other archeologists say that the Gaṅgā dynasty King Narasiṁhadeva, who built the sun temple at Konark, built the offering hall in the twenty-four years of his rule. By reading the inscription found on the door of the nātya-mandira one can understand that Mahārāja Kapilendradeva, who conquered Karnataka, arranged to donate a vast tract of land for the service of Bhuvaneśvara. According to the opinion of many archeologists this nātya-mandira was built many years before the time of Kapilendradeva. Rājā Rājendralāla Mitra said Śālinīkeśarī's queen built this nātya-mandira between A.D. 1099 and 1104, but many archeologists disagree with this. On the right side of the entrance to the deity room there is a inscription that says that Narasiṁhadeva built the Konark sun temple and its entrance. The nātya-mandira and the entrance of the Bhuvaneśvara temple are certainly the glorious work of that valiant Gaṅgā dynasty king. Since the name of that king's daughter is mentioned in that inscription, many people think that the Gaṅgā dynasty king's daughter built it. Some people guess that this king's daughter has been described in the Mādalā-paṅji calendar as Śālinīkeśarī's queen.\n\nThe expertise, artistry, and architectural work in the construction of the jagamohana are superb. The roof of the jagamohana, like the roof of the offering hall, is shaped like a pinnacle. This roof is supported by four giant thirty-foot-tall stone pillars. Left of its southern entrance is a rectangular room decorated with adequate artistic work, but the builder of this room could not complete the work. There are a few brass deities within this room. They are Bhuvaneśvara's vijaya-mūrtis, which are taken out during festivals. The Bhuvaneśvara temple is one hundred sixty feet tall from the ground to the kalasa, but since the deity room is two feet lower than ground level, the eastern courtyard is two to three feet below that. So at one time the height of the dome must have been one hundred sixty-five feet.\n\nApart from the Liṅgarāja Śrī Bhuvaneśvara temple and the Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva temple, there are many other temples situated in the four directions within Bhuvaneśvara. It has already been stated that the Bhuvaneśvara temple is 160 feet tall from the ground level to the kalasa. The Ananta Vāsudeva temple is 60 foot tall. The Rameśvara temple is 78 feet tall, Yameśvara is 67 feet, Rājārāṇī is 63 feet, Bhagavatī is 54 feet, Sārīdeula is 53 feet, Nāgeśvara is 52 feet, Siddheśvara is 47 feet, Kapileśvara is 64 feet, Kedāreśvara is 46 feet, Paraśurāmeśvara is 38 feet, Mukteśvara is 35 feet, and Kopāri is 35 feet tall.\n\nMany people think that the Bhuvaneśvara temple is older than the Jagannātha Purī temple and that the artistic work of the Purī temple is an imitation of the Bhuvaneśvara temple.\n\nRājā Rājendralāla Mitra said that King Yayāti Keśarī came from Magadha, drove away the Yavanas, and reestablished Hindu religion over the ruins of the Buddhist religion. The duration of Yayāti Keśarī's rule extended from A.D. 474 to 526. Construction of the Bhuvaneśvara temple and the jagamohana began near the end of Yayāti Keśarī's rule. Yayāti Keśarī could not complete the construction work. Although his descendent Sūrya Keśarī ruled the kingdom for a long time, he did not try to complete the temple. His heir, Ananta Keśarī, again started the temple construction. The Bhuvaneśvara temple was eventually completed during the reign of Lalāṭendu Keśarī in 588 Śakābda (A.D. 666). Regarding this, Rājā Rājendralāla Mitra has quoted the following verse:\n\ngajāṣṭeṣum ite jāte   śakābde kīrti vāsasahprāsādam akarod rājā   lalāṭenduś ca keśarī\n\nBut some archeologists do not agree with the statement of Mitra Mahāśaya. They say that the stone inscription is similar to the unverified handwritten verses found that describe the construction of the Jagannātha temple and that there is no historical truth in it. They further say that the description Rājā Rājendralāla Mitra quoted from Jagannātha's Mādalā-pañji calendar is a futile attempt by the pāṇḍās, who are ignorant of historical facts, to prove that this holy place is more ancient than it actually is. The exact date of the construction of the Bhuvaneśvara temple and jagamohana is found in a stone inscription carved at the time of that construction. The famous Anaṅga-bhīma, who is said to be the builder of the Śrī Puruṣottama temple, is also described in that stone inscription to be the builder of the Bhuvaneśvara temple. Thirty-four years of Anaṅga-bhīma are described in that stone inscription. In the stone inscription of Cāteśvara and in the royal inscription on a copper plate of the second Narasiṁhadeva the names of two persons called Anaṅga-bhīma, or Aniyaṅka-bhīma, are found. The first Anaṅga-bhīma was the fourth son of Cauḍa Gaṅgā. He ruled the kingdom for ten years. He conquered Orissa and built the temple of Śrī Puruṣottama. The second Anaṅga-bhīma was the grandson of the first Anaṅga-bhīma and the son of Rājarāja. He ruled the kingdom for thirty-four years up to A.D. 1253. Since the stone inscription in the Bhuvaneśvara temple mentions thirty-four years in connection with Aniyaṅka-bhīma, the son of Rājarāja, some archeologists ascertain the second Aniyaṅka-bhīma, or Anaṅga-bhīma, as the actual builder of the Bhuvaneśvara temple. This second Aniyaṅka-bhīma built many large temples in Cuttack and many places in the districts of Purī and Gañjāma.\n\nWe have already discussed something about the temple of Ananta Vāsudeva, situated on the eastern bank of the Bindu-sarovara in front of the middle ghāṭa. This temple is one hundred thirty-one feet long and one hundred seventeen feet wide. The main hall is ninety-six feet long and twenty-five feet wide. Adjacent to the main temple is the jagamohana, behind that is the nātya-mandira, and behind that is the bhoga-maṇḍapa. From ground level to the kalasa, the temple is sixty feet tall. Inside the nātya-mandira is a deity of Garuḍa made of black stone. The Deity of Ananta Vāsudeva Viṣṇu is situated within the main temple. This temple of Ananta Vāsudeva is the most ancient temple in Bhuvaneśvara. This is widely accepted by even the archeologists. No pilgrim visits the temples of deities subordinate to Śrī Vāsudeva without first taking darśana of Ananta Vāsudeva Viṣṇu, the Lord of all. This practice is current in Bhuvaneśvara even today. We have already learned from the verses composed by the poet Vācaspati Miśra and inscribed on a stone attached to the wall of the Ananta Vāsudeva temple that Bhavadeva Bhaṭṭa built the temple of Ananta Vāsudeva and Bindu-sarovara, which is situated in front of the temple. Vācaspati Miśra wrote a book called Nyāya-sūcī-nibandha in 898 Śakābda (A.D. 976). It is not improper to consider his dear friend Bhavadeva Bhaṭṭa as his contemporary. Therefore some archeologists conclude that the temple of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva was built in the tenth century.\n\nBindu-sarovara is thirteen hundred feet long, seven hundred feet wide, and sixteen feet deep. The four banks of this sarovara, or lake, are covered with stone slabs. There is a island built of stone in the middle of Bindu-sarovara. The island is 100x100 feet. There is a small temple in the northeast corner of the island. The festival Deity of Ananta Vāsudeva is brought here during the Snāna-yātrā. The Deity is then bathed by streams of water squirted out of fountains surrounding that temple. During the Snāna-yātrā, in other words, during the rainy season, this Bindu-sarovara becomes the residence of many large crocodiles.\n\nWestern historians like Starling, Hunter, and Cunningham, as well as archeologists of India like Rājā Rājendralāla Mitra have described Bhuvaneśvara as a principal Buddhist center. Other archeologists of India, however, have through argument and evidence like stone inscriptions found in various temples of Bhuvaneśvara and descriptions in ancient Purāṇas like the Mahābhārata demonstrated that there is no evidence to substantiate the claim that Bhuvaneśvara was a principal center for Buddhists during the time of Lord Buddha. The evidence of Buddhism found in Khaṇḍagiri and Udayagiri are from a much later time than that of Lord Buddha. Those who advertised that the elephant cave was a Buddhist cave have been proven completely wrong, because it has now been established as belonging to the Jains. The glories of the Orissan King Kharbel Bhupati, who was a follower of the Jain religion, are found on a stone inscription within this elephant cave. But there is no evidence or proof of the exact date when this Jain Kharbel established his capitol at Bhuvaneśvara. The Mahābhārata, Vana-parva, Chapter 114 states that after the confluence at Gaṅgā-sāgara comes the sacred Vaitaraṇī River in Kaliṅga. Yājapura, where Brahmā performed a sacrifice, is on the bank of this river. After that comes Svayambhu-vana, and then comes Mahāvedi, which is near the ocean and which is renowned as Puruṣottama-kṣetra. After that comes Mahendra Mountain, which is situated in Gañjāma district and which is known as the abode of Paraśurāma. The above-mentioned name Svayambhu refers to Śambhu, or Mahādeva. This is the opinion found in the ancient commentary on Mahābhārata known as Durgaṭārtha-prakāśinī. Since a long time this Svayambhu-vana was a place for ascetics to undergo austerities. It is stated in the Skanda Purāṇa, Utkala-khaṇḍa:\n\nittham etat purā kṣetraṁ   mahādevena nirmitamtatra sākṣād umā-kāntaḥ   sthāpitaḥ parameṣṭhināyad etac chāmbhavaṁ kṣetraṁ   tamaso nāśanaṁ param\n\n“This sacred place was created long ago by Mahādeva. Brahmā personally established the husband of Pārvatī at this place. Since then this place has been known as the destroyer of ignorance and a favorite place of Śambhu. This place is also known as Ekāmraka-vana or Ekāmraka-kṣetra.”\n\nElsewhere in the Skanda Purāṇa, Utkala-khaṇḍa, it is stated:\n\nsa vartate nīlagirir   yojane 'tra tṛtīyakeidam tv ekāmraka-vanaṁ   kṣetraṁ gaurī-pater vidhuḥ\n\ncatur deha sthito 'haṁ vai   yatra nīlamaṇi-mayaḥtasyottarasyāṁ vikhyātaṁ   vanam ekāmrakāhvayam\n\nEkāmraka-kanana, which is very dear to the husband of Pārvatī, is situated two yojanas north of Nīlācala in the state of Orissa. This Ekāmraka-kṣetra is the Svayambhu-vana described in the Mahābhārata, Vana-parva, and many thoughtful persons have concluded that this place is much older than the time of Buddha.\n\nA description of Śrī Bhuvaneśvara deva is found in the Kapila-saṁhita. Long ago Lord Viśveśvara (Śiva) of Kāśī told Devarṣi Nārada that he would not reside in Kāśī any longer and that Kāśī would soon be destroyed because the atheists overwhelmed with mundane knowledge were creating disturbances there. Religious principles would no longer remain, and everyone would become irreligious. Moreover, Kāśī would gradually become crowded, and it would become difficult to perform austerities without disturbance. Although it was a fact that Mahādeva painstakingly established Kāśī for the pleasure of Pārvatī, she was no longer inclined to stay there because of the disturbances created by the atheists. Where, therefore, was the place where one could sit and perpetually worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead? After hearing these statements from Śambhu, the best of the Vaiṣṇavas, Devarṣi Nārada said that there was a famous mountain, Nīla-śaila, situated on the shore of the saltwater ocean. North of this mountain is the most pleasing Ekāmraka-kanana. Vāsudeva, the Lord of Lakṣmī, resides in that solitary forest with Ananta. That place is most confidential. On hearing Nārada's reply, Mahādeva left Kāśī and came to Ekāmraka-vana with Pārvatī. After arriving at this sacred place, Mahādeva said to Śrī Hari, “I have come to Your shelter. Please give me a place to stay near Your lotus feet.” When Śrī Vāsudeva heard the appeal of Śambhu, the topmost Vaiṣṇava, He said, “O Śambhu, I will gladly let you stay here, but you have to promise that you will never return to Kāśī.”Śaṅkara then replied, “How can I leave Kāśī forever? My beloved Jāhnavī (Gaṅgā) and Maṇikarṇikā, the aggregate of all holy places, are situated there.” Vāsudeva said, “O Śambhu, here in front of Me there is Maṇikarṇikā, which is also known as Pāpanāśinī. The river Gaṅgā-Yamunā that emanates from My lotus feet flows southeast of Me. There are many other confidential tīrthas here.”Śaṅkara then replied, “I promise that I will not leave Your lotus feet and go anywhere, even to Vārāṇasī.” After speaking these words, Śambhu stayed south of Viṣṇu in the form of a liṅga. That dark bluish liṅga glows like a crystal and is renowned as Tribhuvaneśvara, or Bhuvaneśvara.\n\nA pañca-krośī(ten mile) Bhuvaneśvara parikramā is performed in the month of Kārtika. The parikramā starts from Varāhadevī, goes through Dhavalagiri, Khaṇḍagiri, Udayagiri, around the Bhuvaneśvara railway station, and eventually returns to the Varāhadevī temple.\n\nBhuvaneśvara is situated 272 miles from Howrah on the Bengal-Nagpur railway line. The Bhuvaneśvara temple is two miles from the Bhuvaneśvara station. The road is most beautiful, being covered on both sides by trees that grow in the mountains, particularly the kuñcilā, or Nux Vomica. No conveyance other than bullox carts is generally available, but buses and motorcars can drive on the road. There are two dharmaśālās in Bhuvaneśvara. On the bank of Bindu-sarovara, a Calcutta Marwari named Hazarimala has built a new large dharmaśālā. The other dharmaśālā was built by one Rāya Bahadur Hargovinda Viśveśvaralala. Pilgrims can stay for three days in those dharmaśālās. There is a charitable hospital, a telegraph office, and a post office. There is an open market every Monday and Thursday. Like Jagannātha prasāda, the prasāda of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva and Bhuvaneśvara is sold.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.309\n\nTEXT 309\n\n`śiva-priya sarovara' jāni śrī-caitanyasnāna kari' viśeṣe karilā ati dhanya\n\nRealizing that the lake was dear to Śiva, Śrī Caitanya eagerly took bath therein and made it glorious.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.310\n\nTEXT 310\n\ndekhilena giyā prabhu prakaṭa śaṅkaracatur-dige śiva-dhvani kare anucara\n\nThereafter the Lord went to see the manifestation of Śaṅkara, whose followers were glorifying him in all directions.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.311\n\nTEXT 311\n\ncatur-dige sāri sāri ghṛta-dīpa jvaleniravadhi abhiṣeka haiteche jale\n\nThere were rows of ghee lamps in the four directions, and the Śiva-liṅga was being continuously bathed with water.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.312\n\nTEXT 312\n\nnija-priya-śaṅkarera dekhiyā vibhavatuṣṭa hailena prabhu, sakala vaiṣṇava\n\nThe Lord and all the Vaiṣṇavas were pleased to see the influence of the Lord's dear devotee Śaṅkara.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.313\n\nTEXT 313\n\nye caraṇa-rase śiva vasana nā jānehena prabhu nṛtya kare śiva-vidyamāne\n\nŚiva forgets to dress in the ecstasy he relishes by serving the lotus feet of that Supreme Lord who was now dancing before him.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.314\n\nTEXT 314\n\nnṛtya-gīta śiva-agre kariyā ānandase rātri rahilā sei grāme gauracandra\n\nAfter joyfully dancing and chanting before Śiva, Gauracandra passed that night in that village.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.315\n\nTEXT 315\n\nsei sthāna śiva pāilena yena-matesei kathā kahi skanda-purāṇera mate\n\nI will now narrate the Skanda Purāṇa description of how Śiva came to this place.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.316\n\nTEXT 316\n\nkāśī-madhye pūrve śiva pārvatī-sahiteāchilā aneka kāla parama-nibhṛte\n\nŚiva and Pārvatī had previously lived for a long time in a solitary place at Kāśī.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.317\n\nTEXT 317\n\ntabe gaurī-saha śiva gelena kailāsanara-rāja-gaṇe kāśī karaye vilāsa\n\nThen Śiva went to Kailāsa with Gaurī, and the human kings began to rule Kāśī.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.318\n\nTEXT 318\n\ntabe kāśīrāja-nāme hailā eka rājākāśīpura bhoga kare kari' śiva-pūjā\n\nThere was one king named Kāśirāja, who worshiped Śiva as he enjoyed the opulence of Kāśī.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.319\n\nTEXT 319\n\ndaive āsi' kālapāśa lāgila tāhāreugra-tape śiva pūje kṛṣṇe jinibāre\n\nBy providence, he became bound by the ropes of time and began worshiping Śiva through severe austerities so that he could defeat Kṛṣṇa in battle.\n\nThe topics of Sudakṣiṇa, the King of Kāśī, are described in the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, Tenth Canto, Chapter Sixty-six as follows:\n\nWhile Lord Baladeva was visiting Nanda's Vraja, King Pauṇḍraka of Karūṣa, encouraged by fools, announced that he was the real Vāsudeva and informed the Supreme Personality of Godhead Vāsudeva that no one other than he himself was Vāsudeva, and therefore Śrī Kṛṣṇa should give up both the name and the symbols of Vāsudeva and take shelter of Pauṇḍraka, otherwise He should fight with him. When Ugrasena and the members of his royal assembly heard Pauṇḍraka's foolish boast, they all laughed heartily. Śrī Kṛṣṇa told Pauṇḍraka's messenger that He would soon make that foolish king drop his artificial symbols like the Sudarśana cakra that he was presently carrying and his body would be eaten by dogs after it fell on the battlefield. Thereafter, when Kṛṣṇa came near Kāśī, Pauṇḍraka immediately led his army on to the battlefield with enthusiasm, and his friend Kāśirāja followed him for support. Just as the fire of universal devastation burns everything in the four directions, Śrī Kṛṣṇa began to destroy the armies of Pauṇḍraka and Kāśirāja with His weapons. Kṛṣṇa then told Pauṇḍraka that He would force him to relinquish the falsely assumed name of Vāsudeva, otherwise if He did not wish to fight He would surrender to Pauṇḍraka. After speaking these words, Kṛṣṇa destroyed Pauṇḍraka's chariot with a sharp arrow and beheaded Pauṇḍraka with His Sudarśana cakra. He then severed the head of Kāśirāja from his body, threw it into Kāśī, and returned to Dvārakā. Since Pauṇḍraka dressed like Śrī Hari and always remembered Kṛṣṇa, he attained liberation.\n\nWhen the queen, children, and relatives of Kāśirāja saw his severed head, they began to cry. Thereafter, with a desire to take revenge on his father's killer, Sudakṣiṇa, the son of Kāśirāja, began to perform severe austerities to please Mahādeva. When Mahādeva became pleased with his austerities and desired to give him a benediction, Sudakṣiṇa requested the means to kill his father's killer. Mahādeva instructed him to worship the Dakṣiṇāgni fire according to the injunctions of the abhicāra ritual. After the sacrifice was completed, a formidable fiery form appeared from the sacrificial fire pit with a fiery trident in his hand. When that demon was sent to Dvārakā, the residents of Dvārakā became frightened and approached Kṛṣṇa, who was engaged in playing chess. Śrī Kṛṣṇa gave them His assurance and ordered Sudarśana cakra to destroy the demon created with the help of Mahādeva. When by the influence of Sudarśana cakra the fire created by the abhicāra ritual was checked, it returned to Vārāṇasī and burned the priests and Sudakṣiṇa to ashes. Sudarśana cakra then entered Vārāṇasī, burned the entire city, and returned to Kṛṣṇa.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.320\n\nTEXT 320\n\npratyakṣa hailāśiva tapera prabhāve`vara māga' balile, se rājā vara māge\n\nBy the influence of his austerity, Śiva appeared before him and said, “Ask for a benediction.” The King then asked for the following benediction.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.320\n\nTEXT 320\n\n“eka vara māgoṅ prabhu, tomāra caraṇeyena muñi kṛṣṇa jinibāre pāroṅ raṇe”\n\n“O Lord, I desire one benediction from you.

Some people consider that Viṣṇu is equal to Rudra or that Viṣṇu is another name of Rudra, and they thus try to synthesize without authority. But all Vedic literatures have refuted their philosophy as follows:\n\nyas tu nārāyaṇaṁ devaṁbrahma-rudrādi-daivataiḥsamatvenaiva vīkṣetasa pāṣaṇḍī bhaved dhruvam\n\n“A person who considers demigods like Brahmā and Śiva to be on an equal level with Nārāyaṇa is to be considered an offender, or pāṣaṇḍī.”\n\nIn the Mahābhārata narration regarding Upamanyu it is said that Śrī Kṛṣṇa performed austerities to please Rudra for the sake of Jāmbavatī's son and that all the demigods and Viṣṇu emanated from Rudra. But where is the justification for this conclusion?\n\nThe understanding of those who conclude in this way without realizing the actual purport of the scriptures is extremely crude. The reason for this is that the scriptures describe that when Rudra was fighting on behalf of King Bāṇa, he was defeated by Viṣṇu and he then glorified Viṣṇu as the original Personality of Godhead. He was also bewildered by Mohinī, saved from the hands of Vṛkāsura, and delivered from the sin of killing a brāhmaṇa. The reason why Lord Viṣṇu sometimes displays the pastime of worshiping Rudra is described in the scriptures as follows:\n\nIn the Siddhānta-ratna, Third Pāda, texts 22, 23, 26, 27 it is stated: “By displaying the pastime of worshiping His own form as Rudra, Lord Viṣṇu taught the worship of Rudra not to His own sincere devotees but to the insincere living entities who desire religiosity, economic development, sense gratification, and liberation. This fact has been confirmed by the Lord Himself when He spoke in the Nārāyaṇīya to Arjuna as follows: `O Arjuna, I am the soul of the universe. My worship of Rudra is worship of My own Self. Whatever I do, common people follow. Examples set by Me should be followed. That is why I worship Rudra. Viṣṇu does not offer obeisances to any demigod. I worship Rudra, considering him to be My own Self. I am the indwelling Supersoul of the entire universe. I worship My own partial expansion, Rudra, who is nondifferent from Me as molten iron is nondifferent from fire. I have set the standard that the demigods headed by Rudra should be worshiped. If I did not set the example of worshiping Rudra, then people would not follow that standard. Therefore I teach the worship of My servants through My personal behavior. There is no one greater than or equal to Me. Therefore, since I am the greatest, I do not worship anyone. But since Rudra is My partial expansion I display the example of worshiping Rudra and other demigods to teach ordinary people.' In this connection Brahmā told Rudra that Viṣṇu alone is the Supersoul of everyone including Brahmā and Rudra. He said, `Lord Viṣṇu is the Supersoul of you, me, and all other embodied living entities. No one can restrict Him within the confines of their mundane knowledge.'\n\n“If simply because Śrī Rāmacandra displayed the pastime of worshiping Lord Śiva to teach the worship of that great Vaiṣṇava, Śiva should be considered the Supreme Lord and Rāmacandra should be considered subordinate, then since Śrī Rāmacandra worshiped the ocean, the ocean should also be considered the Supreme Lord. It should be understood that whenever the associates of the Supreme Lord have enacted the pastime of worshiping demigods, their purpose was to teach the worship of the demigods, who are subordinate to Viṣṇu. It is the pastime of the Lord's associates to teach, `all demigods are subordinate to Viṣṇu,' yet such worship should never be accepted as the ultimate conclusion. Lord Viṣṇu is certainly the controller of everyone. His activity of maintaining the universe, like Brahmā's activity of creation and Rudra's activity of annihilation, and His interaction with the demigods is just like a king's interaction with thieves. Actually Brahmā and Rudra create and annihilate only after being empowered by Viṣṇu. Therefore Lord Viṣṇu is certainly eternally worshipable to all the demigods headed by Brahmā and Rudra.”\n\nIt further stated in the Siddhānta-ratna, Third Pāda, texts 13-14: “In the Skanda Purāṇa it is stated that Lord Viṣṇu kept some names like Nārāyaṇa for Himself, and He gave some names like Brahmā and Rudra to the demigods. As a king gives villages other than his own capitol to his ministers and servants for their residence, the supremely independent Personality of Godhead Viṣṇu also gives names other than a few special ones to the demigods for their use.\n\n“Rudra is known for deriding the desire for liberation and for having a fierce form. Therefore it is stated in the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (1.2.26):\n\nmumukṣavo ghora-rūpān   hitvā bhūta-patīn athanārāyaṇa-kalāḥśāntā   bhajanti hy anasūyavaḥ\n\n`Those who are serious about liberation are certainly nonenvious, and they respect all. Yet they reject the horrible and ghastly forms of the demigods and worship only the all-blissful forms of Lord Viṣṇu and His plenary portions.'”\n\nIt has already been shown by quoting Vyāsadeva's words and it has been proved by quoting the Purāṇic incident mentioned in Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata that Śrī Bhuvaneśvara should not be seen as a fierce form of Rudra or as an ordinary liṅga. In the consideration of pure Vaiṣṇavas, Śrī Bhuvaneśvara is most dear to Kṛṣṇa and is therefore nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa. The Śrī Rūpānuga Vaiṣṇavas consider Śrī Bhuvaneśvara in the form of Śrī Gopālinī-śakti and pray to him for the service of the divine young couple, Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Govinda.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.400\n\nTEXT 400\n\nśikṣā-guru īśvarera śikṣā ye nā mānenija-doṣe duḥkha pāya sei saba jane\n\nThose who do not follow the teachings of the Supreme Lord, who is the instructing spiritual master of all, suffer miseries because of their own faults.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.401\n\nTEXT 401\n\nsei śiva-grāme prabhu bhakta-vṛnda-saṅgeśiva-liṅga dekhi' dekhi' bhramilena raṅge\n\nIn that abode of Śiva, the Lord and His associates happily wandered about seeing the Śiva-liṅgas.\n\nOf the deities situated within the walls of the temple, Ekāmraka-śiva is situated at the base of the mango tree and is facing west. North of the mango tree is a Śiva-liṅga named Ugreśvara, who is the chief of eleven hundred thousand liṅgas. Beyond him is Viśveśvara-liṅga. West of Gaṇanātha are Nandī and Mahākāla. These two were worshiped by Citragupta, so they are also known as Citragupteśa. Nearby is Sabareśvara-liṅga. In the southwest is Laḍḍukeśvara Śiva, the chief of nine hundred thousand liṅgas. Near him is Śakreśvara Śiva.\n\nBindu-sarovara, Ananta Vāsudeva, Puruṣottama, Padaharā, Tīrtheśvara, and Bhuvaneśvara, who is the combination of eight forms, are found in the first of eight concentric rings. Kapila-kuṇḍa, Pāpanāśana-kuṇḍa, Maitreśa, and Vāruṇeśa are situated in the second ring. Beyond this is Pāpanāśana-tīrtha.\n\nSouth of Pāpanāśana-kuṇḍa is Īśāneśvara Śiva. Northwest of him is Yameśvara-liṅga. Gaṅgeśvara-liṅga is situated in the third concentric ring. Gaṅgā and Yamunā flow a short distance northeast of there. In the Satya-yuga, Gaṅgā and Yamunā flowed there slowly with a desire to see Bhuvaneśvara and offered prayers to Bhuvaneśvara by chanting mantras from the four Vedas. When Bhuvaneśvara was satisfied by their prayers and asked what they desired, they expressed their desire to live eternally in Ekāmraka-kṣetra. Śrī Bhuvaneśvara then awarded them a place in the southeast. By taking bath in these two tīrthas—Gaṅgā and Yamunā one attains devotional service to Viṣṇu, the result of taking bath in the Gaṅgā and Yamunā. There is also a place known as Devī-pada-tīrtha in this third ring. We have already described the Purāṇic incident regarding this Devī-pada-tīrtha. The beautiful lake that Pārvatīdevī created after killing the two demons Kṛtti and Vāsa is renowned as Devī-pada-tīrtha. By taking bath in that Devī-pada-tīrtha and worshiping Gopālinī on the eighth day of the waxing moon in the month of Phālguna one attains one's desired results. Southeast of this tīrtha Śrī Lakṣmīdevī established a liṅga in a temple constructed by Viśvakarmā. That liṅga is known as Lakṣmīśvara. In the fourth ring, Koṭī-tīrtha and Koṭīśvara are situated. When the demigods attempted to construct temples in Bhuvaneśvara, Śrī Bhuvaneśvara ordered them through a voice in the sky to perform a sacrifice in the northeast corner. When the demigods followed his order by constructing temples, establishing deities, performing fire sacrifices, and offering prayers, Bhuvaneśvara was pleased and decided to give them a benediction. The demigods then prayed that their sacrificial pit would become a tīrtha, and their desire was fulfilled. This place is renowned as Koṭī-tīrtha. By taking bath in this Koṭī-tīrtha, one attains the supreme destination. In the fourth ring, the Śiva-liṅga known as Svarṇa-jaleśvara is situated. This Svarṇa-jaleśvara-liṅga is situated 70 dhanu, or 280 cubits (a cubit is about a foot and a half), northeast of Bindu-sarovara. Near this liṅga there is a kuṇḍa, the water of which is used for bathing the liṅga. There is a Svarneśvara-liṅga within that kuṇḍa.\n\nSureśvara-tīrtha, which measures 200 cubit in diameter, is situated four hundred cubits northeast of Bhuvaneśvara. Sureśvara Mahādeva is situated there. Nearby are Siddheśvara, Mukteśvara, Svarṇa-jaleśvara, Parameśvara, Āmrātakeśvara, Brahmeśvara, Megheśvara, Kedāreśvara, Cakreśvara, Viśveśvara, and Kapileśvara. By worshiping these liṅgas one attains devotional service to Viṣṇu. Southeast of Siddheśvara is the famous Kedāreśvara, a Śiva-liṅga that faces south. East of Siddheśvara is Cakreśvara Śiva, and beyond that is Yajñeśvara, or Indreśvara, Śiva.\n\nThe demigods worshiped that liṅga out of devotion to Viṣṇu and had Viśvakarmā construct a temple. As a result, Bhuvaneśa (Viṣṇu) became pleased and gave them the benediction that this liṅga would be known as Siddheśvara, because Śiva, who is very dear to Viṣṇu, was directly present in that liṅga and would award perfection in the worship of Viṣṇu. Siddhāśrama, which awards perfection, is situated 800 cubits from the Siddheśvara-liṅga. Near Siddhāśrama is Mukteśvara Śiva. Near Mukteśvara is Siddha-kuṇḍa, and south of Siddha-kuṇḍa is Puṇya-kuṇḍa. South of Siddheśvara is Kedāradeva, with Gaurīdevī situated by his side. Near Gaurīdevī is Gaurī-kuṇḍa. Since Himālaya worshiped that liṅga, it became known as Hema-kedāra. Streams of crystal clear water emanate west, south, and north of this liṅga. In front of this self-manifested liṅga is a Bhava-pīṭha. Near this Bhava-pīṭha there are three Rudra-liṅgas—Śānti-śiva, Śānta-śiva, and Daityeśvara—who were worshiped by the Maruts. Hiraṇyakaśipu heard a voice from the sky say, “Worship Daityeśvara-śiva, who is generally worshiped by the Daityas and who is situated west of Siddheśvara.” East of Siddheśvara is Indreśvara, who was worshiped by Indra. In the fifth concentric ring there is Brahmeśvara-liṅga and Brahma-kuṇḍa, which appeared during the sacrifice performed by Brahmā. Four hundred forty cubits northeast (a little southeast) past Kṛtti-Vāsa is Gokarṇeśvara. Suṣeṇa and Gokarṇāsura worshiped this liṅga. Near this liṅga are Utpaleśvara and Āmrātakeśvara liṅgas. In the sixth ring Megheśvara-liṅga is situated. Since this liṅga, which is 6800 cubits northeast of kalpa-vṛkṣa, was established and worshiped by the clouds (megha), this liṅga became renowned as Megheśvara. West of Megheśvara is Bhāskareśvara-liṅga, which was worshiped by Bhāskara, the sun-god. Mahādeva and Sūrya are perpetually worshiped six thousand cubits past this place. Three thousand two hundred cubits west of Bhāskareśvara is Kapāla-mocana-śiva. In the seventh ring is Alābu-tīrtha. When one brāhmaṇa friend of Indra performed austerities for one thousand years of the demigods, Bhuvaneśa became pleased with him and awarded him the benediction that his begging bowl and waterpot (made of alābu, or squash) would transform into a tīrtha. When the Lord touched that waterpot, it turned into a divine lake. South of this lake is Auttareśa. Auttareśvara is situated west of Kedāreśvara. This three-eyed liṅga is effulgent, marked with the impression of the moon on his forehead, decorated with a garland of planets and stars, smeared with the ashes from a funeral pyre, decorated with snakes, endowed with a fierce face, and naked. Near this Auttareśvara-liṅga there are three witches who are fond of flesh and blood, who are fully intoxicated, who have crooked reddish eyes, and who are fond of singing and playing instruments. It is heard that Vasiṣṭha and Vāmadeva live at this place. Near this place there is a liṅga named Bhīmeśa, who takes away everyone's fear. In the eighth ring there is a Rāma-kuṇḍa, also called Aśoka-jhara, which appeared from the Aśvamedha (horse) sacrifice. Within this ring are liṅgas like Rāmeśvara, Sīteśvara, Hanumadīśvara, Lakṣmaṇīśvara, Bharateśvara, Śatrughneśvara, Laveśvara, and Gosahasreśvara.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.402\n\nTEXT 402\n\nparama nibhṛta eka dekhi' śiva-sthānasukhī hailā śrī-gaurasundara bhagavāna\n\nWhen Śrī Gaurasundara saw a temple of Śiva in a most solitary place, He became joyful.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.403\n\nTEXT 403\n\nsei grāme yateka āchaye devālayasaba dekhilena śrī-gaurāṅga mahāśaya\n\nLord Gaurāṅga visited all the temples in that place.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.404\n\nTEXT 404\n\nei mate sarva-pathe santoṣe āsiteuttarilā āsi' prabhu kamalapurete\n\nIn this way the Lord happily traveled all the way and eventually arrived at Kamalapura.\n\nIn this regard one should see Caitanya-caritāmṛta (Madhya 5.141), which states: kamalapure āsi bhārgīnadī-snāna kaila—“When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu arrived at Kamalapura, He took His bath in the Bhārgīnadī River.” The flag on top of the Jagannātha temple can be seen from this village.

Being bewildered by the Lord's illusory energy and considering Mahāprabhu an ordinary living entity and a sannyāsī, Sārvabhauma gave the Lord various instructions and ascertained the uselessness of accepting Māyāvāda sannyāsa in Vaiṣṇava dharma. He also quoted statements of Śrī Śaṅkarācārya to substantiate that it was not Śrī Śaṅkara's internal intention to establish the philosophy of oneness between the living entities and the Lord. On the pretext of humility the Lord revealed to Sārvabhauma that His sole purpose in accepting sannyāsa was to display the pastime of cultivating Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was considering Mahāprabhu as simply an exalted sannyāsī. When Mahāprabhu inquired from Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya about the meaning of the ātmārāma verse, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya explained it in thirteen different ways. Without touching any of those explanations, Mahāprabhu astonished Sārvabhauma with many new meanings and then displayed to Sārvabhauma His six-armed form. Sārvabhauma thus fell unconscious to the ground, and Mahāprabhu brought him back to consciousness by placing His hand on Sārvabhauma's body. Then, out of His causeless mercy, Mahāprabhu placed His lotus feet on the chest of Sārvabhauma, who by the Lord's mercy became filled with ecstasy and profusely repented for his audacity of previously instructing Mahāprabhu. He then prayed to the Lord for loving devotional service and began to glorify Him by composing one hundred verses. Mahāprabhu then told Sārvabhauma that persons who recite those one hundred verses, called Sārvabhauma-śataka, would certainly attain pure devotional service to Him. The Lord also told Sārvabhauma not to inform the public about the six-armed form that He had manifested for as long as He remained in this world. After delivering Sārvabhauma, the Lord made the lives of the residents of Nīlācala successful by distributing to them the mellows of the holy names of Hari. Gradually devotees like Śrī Paramānanda Purī, Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara, Pradyumna Miśra, and Rāya Rāmānanda came to join the Lord and began to enjoy ecstatic saṅkīrtana pastimes with the Lord. While taking darśana of Lord Jagannātha, Śrī Nityānanda, who was intoxicated by the mellows of ecstatic love for Śrī Caitanya, would sometimes attempt to grab Jagannātha. One day He climbed on the golden throne, and after embracing Balarāma, He took the flower garland from Balarāma's neck and put it on His own neck. Mahāprabhu lived with the devotees on the seashore and would pass the entire night enjoying kīrtana pastimes and displaying symptoms of ecstatic love. The Lord would exhibit wonderful ecstatic emotions whenever He heard Śrī Gadādhara Paṇḍita's recitation of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam. One day Mahāprabhu came to Śrī Purī Gosvāmī's monastery and found out that the water in his well was unfit for any use. By the Lord's benediction the sacred Ganges entered his well the very next day, and the well was filled with pure water. When Mahāprabhu came to see the well water, He told the devotees that anyone who takes bath in that water would attain pure devotional service to Kṛṣṇa, the same result one attains by taking bath in the Ganges. At that time Mahāprabhu elaborately described the glories of Śrīla Purī Gosvāmī. When Mahāprabhu first arrived in Nīlācala, Pratāparudra, the King of Utkal, was engaged elsewhere in a military campaign, so he was not able to see the Lord. After Mahāprabhu stayed for some time in Nīlācala, He returned to Gauḍa-deśa. In spite of trying to live secretly in Vidyānagara at the house of Vidyā Vācaspati, the brother of Sārvabhauma, news of His arrival was made public and the place of Vācaspati filled with people. On hearing the loud commotion of the holy name of Hari, Mahāprabhu gave darśana to everyone. He blessed everyone by saying, “May your minds be fixed on Kṛṣṇa,” and He instructed them to worship Kṛṣṇa. In order to avoid the crowd Mahāprabhu secretly left for Kuliyā without informing Vācaspati. Meanwhile, Vācaspati became afflicted by the Lord's separation on one hand and on the other hand the crowd continually accused him of hiding Mahāprabhu in his house. When Vācaspati heard from a brāhmaṇa about the Lord's departure for Kuliyā, he immediately informed everyone and personally led them to Kuliyā. To counter people's baseless charge against Vācaspati, Mahāprabhu, on Vācaspati's request, gave darśana to everyone and made their lives glorious by awarding them the mellows of saṅkīrtana desired by the best of the sages and yogis. When a brāhmaṇa asked the Lord about the atonement for committing offenses to a Vaiṣṇava, the Lord said that one who drinks poison should counteract the effect of the poison by drinking nectar with the same mouth. Similarly, glorification of a Vaiṣṇava's transcendental qualities is the only atonement for blaspheming a Vaiṣṇava. By the influence of Vakreśvara Paṇḍita's association, Devānanda Paṇḍita developed faith in Mahāprabhu and attained His mercy. Mahāprabhu described the glories of Vakreśvara Paṇḍita to Devānanda Paṇḍita. After his offense was nullified, Devānanda Paṇḍita developed humility and inquired from the Lord about the process of explaining Śrīmad Bhāgavatam. Mahāprabhu replied that pure devotional service is the ultimate goal of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, and that Śrīmad Bhāgavatam is eternal and unique. Those who try to equate other literatures with Śrīmad Bhāgavatam or try to equate other opinions, paths, or mental speculations with pure devotional service, which is the goal of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, do not know anything about Śrīmad Bhāgavatam. Accepting the book Bhāgavata and the devotee Bhāgavata to be nondifferent, one should always serve the Bhāgavata by offerings of glorification. Lord Nityānanda is the personification of the devotional mellows of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam.

The Lord went to the village of Rāmakeli, situated on the bank of the Ganges near Gauḍa, with the desire to spend four or five days at a solitary place there. But after news of Mahāprabhu's arrival in Rāmakeli quickly spread everywhere, His loud roaring, kīrtana, crying, and His appeal to everyone to chant the holy name of Hari attracted the attention of even the infidels. When the local constable related the topics of this wonderful sannyāsī to the King, even that infidel King Hussain Shah considered that Mahāprabhu was the Supreme Lord. Still, fearing that it was not impossible that the King's mind might change through the conspiracy of wicked people, some devotees secretly sent a messenger to the Lord requesting Him to leave Rāmakeli. When a brāhmaṇa informed the Lord's associates about this, their hearts filled with anxiety. The Lord, who is the Supersoul of everyone, then instilled fearlessness in them by personally revealing His own omnipotence and His supremacy that is unknown even to the Vedas, and He promised that He would distribute the holy name to everyone in this age except the offenders at the feet of Vaiṣṇavas. Mahāprabhu also predicted that His name would be spread to every town and village throughout the world. Changing His plan to go to Mathurā, Mahāprabhu started walking south from Rāmakeli and eventually reached the house of Advaita in Śāntipura. In this connection the author relates an incident to show the difference between the extraordinary attachment for Lord Caitanya of Śrī Acyutānanda the son of Śrī Advaita and the behavior of Advaita's other so-called sons, who are averse to Lord Caitanya. One day an exalted sannyāsī came to Śrī Advaita's house and inquired from Him about how Keśava Bhāratī was related to Caitanya. According to worldly etiquette Śrī Advaita Ācārya said that Keśava Bhāratī was the spiritual master of Caitanya. On hearing this reply, the five-year-old naked Acyutānanda smilingly yet in an angry mood asked his father what kind of conclusion was it that the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Caitanya, the spiritual master of all, has a spiritual master? After hearing this conclusive statement from His five-year-old son Acyutānanda, Śrī Advaita Ācārya said that Acyuta was actually the father and He was the son. Acyutānanda has appeared in this world as His son to teach the actual truth. When after speaking in this way Advaita begged forgiveness from His son, Acyutānanda became embarrassed and bent his head down. And on seeing the proper exchange of etiquette between a perfect father and a perfect son, the sannyāsī became stunned and then happily left that place while chanting the holy name of Hari. In this regard Ṭhākura Vṛndāvana describes the glories of Śrī Acyutānanda, who is fixed at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya, and the position of Śrī Advaita's other so-called sons, who are fit to be punished by Yamarāja. When Śrī Advaita Ācārya was thus overwhelmed by the behavior of Śrī Acyutānanda, Śrī Gaurasundara arrived there with His associates. Śrīman Mahāprabhu bestowed special mercy on Acyutānanda and stayed at the house of Advaita to enjoy His saṅkīrtana pastimes. Advaita Ācārya then sent a palanquin and some men to Navadvīpa to bring Mother Śacī, who was afflicted with separation from the Lord and who was nondifferent from Mother Yaśodā, to Śāntipura. Immediately after hearing about the Lord's arrival, when Mother Śacī along with Gaṅgādāsa Paṇḍita, Murāri Gupta, and other devotees came to Śāntipura, Mahāprabhu circumambulated her and offered prayers to her by addressing her as Devakī, Yaśodā, Devahūti, Pṛśni, Kauśalyā, and Aditi. The devotees glorified the wonderful extent of Mother Śacī's devotional service and praised the glories of the name āi. Advaita Ācārya took permission from the Lord for Mother Śacī to personally cook and feed Him. After Mother Śacī cooked various types of vegetables and as many as twenty varieties of the Lord's favorite śāka (spinach) and offered them to the Lord, Mahāprabhu relished those foodstuffs with great satisfaction while praising Mother Śacī's wonderful cooking and the stimulation for varieties of service awakened by those various śākas, which are dear to Kṛṣṇa.\n\nThe nectarean remnants of Mahāprabhu were plundered and relished by the devotees. Then Śrī Murāri Gupta recited prayers in glorification to Lord Rāmacandra before Mahāprabhu and His associates. Placing His lotus feet on Murāri's head, Mahāprabhu awarded him the benediction that he would remain the eternal servant of Rāma. When a leper approached Mahāprabhu and related to Him topics of his pathetic condition, Mahāprabhu became very angry, and after declaring that the leper was untouchable and unworthy of being spoken to, Mahāprabhu asked him to leave that place. He further pointed out that if he were unable to tolerate at present the pains of leprosy, then how would he tolerate the pains of suffering for unlimited future births in the hell known as Kumbhipāka? His present pathetic condition was the result of his committing offense at the feet of Śrīvāsa. In this regard Mahāprabhu glorified the unparalleled position of the Vaiṣṇavas by describing how worship of Vaiṣṇavas was superior to worship of Kṛṣṇa and how offense to the Vaiṣṇavas was more grave than offense at the feet of Kṛṣṇa. When the offending leper repented for his offensive act and surrendered at the lotus feet of the Lord, the Lord revealed to him that the only means for getting freedom from offense to a Vaiṣṇava was to sincerely beg forgiveness at the feet of the Vaisnava whom one had offended. When the leper then begged Śrīvāsa for forgiveness, by Śrīvāsa's mercy he became free from offense. At the outset of describing Śrī Mādhavendra Purī's appearance festival the author describes in brief the glories of Śrī Mādhavendra Purī and how he met Śrī Advaita Prabhu. While Mahāprabhu and His associates stayed at the house of Advaita, the appearance festival of Śrī Mādhavendra Purī arrived. Śrī Advaita Ācārya Prabhu along with Mahāprabhu and the devotees celebrated the occasion with a huge saṅkīrtana festival. In this regard the author describes the ecstatic condition of Mahāprabhu, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, Śrī Advaita Prabhu, and other devotees during the celebration of the festival, the cooking arrangements made by the Vaiṣṇavas' wives under the direction of Mother Śacī, Mahāprabhu's ecstasy in the kīrtana, His revelation of Advaita's glories and the method for worshiping Kṛṣṇa's dear devotee Lord Śiva, Mahāprabhu and the devotee's kīrtana during the festival honoring Mādhavendra Purī, the Lord's pastime of honoring prasāda, and topics such as the Lord's offering flower garlands and sandalwood pulp to the devotees headed by Śrī Nityānanda.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.001\n\nTEXT 1\n\njaya jaya kṛpā-sindhu jaya gauracandrajaya jaya sakala-maṅgala-pada-dvandva\n\nAll glories to Gauracandra, the ocean of mercy!

The inhabitants of that village were all brāhmaṇas.\n\nŚrī Rāmakeli is situated eight and a half miles south of English Bazaar, near the present city of Maldah. Within this village there is a concrete-paved area, and in the middle of this there is a large tamāla tree with two kadamba trees on each side of it. The two kadamba trees on the right side are referred to as Śrī Advaita Prabhu, the middle tamāla tree is referred to as Śrī Gaurasundara, and the two kadamba trees on the left side are referred to as Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu. It is said that Śrīman Mahāprabhu first met Śrīla Rūpa and Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī Prabhus in the dead of night under this tree. Sitting in this place, Śrīman Mahāprabhu instructed Śrī Sanātana to join Him. Next to the kadamba trees there is a small temple wherein Śrī Madana-mohanadeva is worshiped. The Deity of Śrī Madana-mohanadeva was established by Śrī Rūpa and Sanātana. There are four sets of Deities within this temple. One of those sets is Śrī Baladeva and Revatī. The names of the Deities, from left, are (1) Vraja-mohana (with Rādhā), (2) Revatī-ramaṇa (with Revatī), and (3) Madana-mohana and (4) Gopīnātha (both with Rādhā). There are also śālagrāma-śilās in the temple. In the midst of the Deities there are two Deities of Śrī Gaurasundara, one of Śrī Advaita Prabhu, and one of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu. There are one hundred twenty-five bighās of land (about forty-two acres) allotted to the service of the Deities. From the public a sum of one hundred twenty-two rupees was collected, out of which eighty rupees was given to the government.\n\nNorth of the Śrī Madana-mohana temple is Śrī Sanātana-kuṇḍa. Around that place are eight other kuṇḍas headed by Rādhā-kuṇḍa, Śyāma-kuṇḍa, Lalitā-kuṇḍa, and Viśākhā-kuṇḍa. A little distance from here is a large lake named Śrī Rūpa-sāgara, which was established by Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī. This Rūpa-sāgara is situated between the Śrī Madana-mohana temple and the court of Hussain Shah. The bathing ghāṭas of Rūpa-sāgara are covered with marble. On one of those marble slabs it is written: “This Rūpa-sāgara-ghāṭa of Śrī Rāmakeli was built in 1268 of the Bengali era from the donations of the mercantile communities of the Maldah district of Bengal. The water covers ten bighās (about three and a half acres), and with the banks it covers 20 bighās (about six and a half acres).”\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile south of Śrī Rāmakeli is a large hall that is named Bāra-duyārī, because it has twelve doors. Up to 1801, during the time of Krent Sahib, the pillars of this hall were covered with gold. This hall is known by people as the court of Hussain Shah. It is said that Dabira Khāsa had his office in this court. There are four gateways situated on the four sides of this hall. It is said that the King used to enjoy hāoyā, or fresh air, at the Hāoyāsa-khāna-ghāṭa. It is further said that when Śrī Sanātana escaped from prison by giving seven thousand gold coins to the Yavana guard, he crossed the Ganges that night, came to this place, and began to cry out, “Śrī Gaurāṅga! Śrī Gaurāṅga!”At that time a crocodile came there and circumambulated Śrī Sanātana seven times. Śrī Sanātana then sat on the back of that crocodile and crossed the Ganges. Śrī Gaṅgādevī presently flows about a half mile from the Śrī Madana-mohana temple. Apart from these, many glories of Hussain Shah Bādasāha are still present there. There is a dakhala-daraoyājā (the main entrance), a parikhā (the moat), and a phiroja khān (the oldest ruin—a tall tower from which one could see the entire city of ancient Gauḍa). There are also ruins of the treasury, the library, and the Loṭana Mosque (which is one of the finest examples of architectural work). Before Moslem rule, this place was the capital of Lakṣmaṇa Sena known as Lakṣmaṇāvatī. Its ruins can still be seen here.\n\nThe capital of the Sena dynasty situated in the Maldah district was the capital of Gauḍa. The Ganges presently flows some distance from this place. The village of Rāmakeli is situated a short distance from the capital of Gauḍa. Both Śrī Sanātana and Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī used to live in this village of Rāmakeli.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.006\n\nTEXT 6\n\ndina-cāri-pāñca prabhu sei puṇya-sthāneāsiyā rahilā yena keha nāhi jāne\n\nThe Lord came to that holy place and stayed there for four or five days without the knowledge of others.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.007\n\nTEXT 7\n\nsūryera udaya ki kakhana gopya haya?sarva loka śunilena caitanya-vijaya\n\nHow is it possible to hide the sun?

Advaita is like the incarnation of fire for anyone who is faithless and who disrespects the words of Mahāprabhu. Although Advaita is as cooling as millions of moons, He is like the fire of destruction for persons averse to Lord Caitanya.\n\nAfter seeing various opulences and the arrangement of foodstuffs at the house of Śrī Advaita, Gaurasundara became greatly pleased and encouraged Advaita Prabhu and future ācāryas following in the footsteps of Advaita Prabhu to conduct festivals with great opulent like this. But envious people engaged in service with great opulence desire to go to hell by considering Him primarily concerned with opulence. The minimization of the Ācārya's position because of His external display of opulence in the course of His own cultivation of sweetness may be considered proper in the eyes of impersonalists, but it is not approved by either Gaurasundara or His devotees. The devotees of the Lord are like fire or Yama, the lord of death, for those who are envious of the Lord and the devotees.\n\nWhen the Gauḍīya Maṭha conducted festivals, processions, and other opulent functions to benefit the living entities, the sinful sahajiyās initiated in the principle of enviousness practiced by members of the Kuliyā apa-sampradāyas brought about their own inauspiciousness by criticizing the activities of the servants in the Gauḍīya Maṭha.

At the meeting between Vāsudeva Datta Ṭhākura and Mahāprabhu, Mahāprabhu narrated the glories of Vāsudeva Datta. Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita and his brother Rāmāi were very dear to Mahāprabhu on account of their unlimited services like performing saṅkīrtana, reciting Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, and performing dramas. One day Mahāprabhu asked Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita why he didn’t endeavor at all to feed and cloth his extensive family. How would he maintain their livelihood? In reply, Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita said that he did not wish to go anywhere to earn money, for whatever was destined would certainly happen. Then Mahāprabhu said, “Śrīvāsa, you should take sannyāsa.”Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita replied, “I cannot do that.” Mahāprabhu said, “Then how will you maintain your family members?”Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita clapped his hands and counted, “One, two, three.” Mahāprabhu asked him the meaning of this, and Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita said, “If I do not get any food even after fasting for three consecutive days, then I will tie a heavy pitcher to my neck and jump into the Ganges.” As soon as Mahāprabhu heard Śrīvāsa’s words, He roared loudly and said, “Even if Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, happens to beg, you will not be affected by poverty. Did you forget My words in Bhagavad-gītā that anyone who thinks of Me without deviation (ananyāś cinta), I supply what they lack and preserve what they have? For someone who is personally maintained by the supreme maintainer of the entire universe, what anxiety will he have for food and cloth? I give you the benediction that even if you sit at home, all ingredients for Kṛṣṇa’s service will automatically come to you.” Mahāprabhu then ordered Rāmāi to continually serve his elder brother and exalted Vaiṣṇava Śrīvāsa.\n\nFrom Śrīvāsa’s house, Mahāprabhu went to Rāghava Paṇḍita’s house in Pānihāṭi, where many devotees gathered to see the Lord. The Lord privately instructed Rāghava Paṇḍita to see Himself (Śrī Gaurasundara) and Nityānanda as nondifferent, and He ordered Makaradhvaja Kara to serve Śrī Rāghava Paṇḍita. Thereafter Mahāprabhu went from Pānihāṭi to a house in Varāhanagara belonging to a particular devotee brāhmaṇa who was expert in reciting Śrīmad Bhāgavatam. On hearing his recitation of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam, the Lord became especially pleased and awarded him the designation Bhāgavata Ācārya.\n\nIn this way the Lord stayed in various devotees’ houses in each of the villages along the banks of the Ganges in Bengal and performed kīrtana and dancing and fulfilled the desires of everyone, then He again went to Nīlācala and stayed at the house of Kāśī Miśra. On hearing that Mahāprabhu had returned to Nīlācala, King Pratāparudra came to Purī from his capital of Cuttack and displayed intense eagerness to see the Lord as he made special requests to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and other devotees to arrange for him to meet the Lord. When the devotees saw the King’s intense eagerness, they advised him to watch the Lord’s dancing from a hidden place. But when the King saw saliva frothing from the Lord’s mouth, dust on the Lord’s body, and other symptoms Mahāprabhu displayed while dancing in transcendental madness, he was unable to understand Mahāprabhu’s transcendental ecstatic transformations and after falling asleep with a doubtful mind he saw in a dream that the body of Śrī Jagannātha was also covered with saliva and dust. When the King tried to touch Śrī Jagannātha in the dream, Jagannātha cautioned him by saying, “Your bodily limbs adorned with sandalwood pulp mixed with musk are never fit to touch My body covered with saliva and dust.” At that moment King Pratāparudra saw Śrī Caitanyadeva sitting in the same place where Jagannātha had been sitting and His body covered in the same way with saliva and dust. As the King attempted to touch Him, Śrī Gaurahari said to Pratāparudra, “Since you have aversion for Me in your mind, why do you want to touch Me?” As the King woke up, he became extremely repentant and realized that Śrī Gaurasundara was nondifferent from Śrī Jagannātha.\n\nOne day as Mahāprabhu was sitting in a flower garden with His associates, King Pratāparudra came and offered obeisances to the Lord by falling flat like an uprooted banana tree and symptoms of ecstatic love manifested in the body of the King. The King then began to speak to the Lord with utmost humility. The Lord showered His merciful benediction on the King and told him that He came to Nīlācala only for the sake of Rāya Rāmānanda, Sārvabhauma, and Pratāparudra. He also told the King that he should not reveal the actual identity of the Lord, who was enacting the pastimes of a covered incarnation, for as long as the Lord was present on this planet. The Lord then offered the garland He was wearing to the King and gave him permission to leave.\n\nOne day in Nīlācala, Śrī Mahāprabhu called Nityānanda to a solitary place, and while discussing with Him about the preaching of pure devotional service in Bengal, the Lord sent Nityānanda along with His associates to Bengal to fulfill His mission there. During their journey to Bengal the eternally perfect Vraja associates of Śrī Baladeva Nityānanda manifested their self-evident sentiments of Vraja. Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu went to the house of Rāghava Paṇḍita in Pānihāṭi, where Nityānanda heard a kīrtana performed by the expert kīrtana leader Mādhava Ghoṣa and became absorbed in wonderful ecstatic love. As Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu climbed on the throne of Lord Viṣṇu, the devotees headed by Rāghava Paṇḍita performed the Lord’s abhiṣeka ceremony. When Nityānanda Prabhu ordered Rāghava Paṇḍita to quickly bring a garland of kadamba flowers, Rāghava Paṇḍita saw that by the will of Śrī Nityānanda many kadamba flowers had blossomed out of season in the lime tree situated in his courtyard. Rāghava Paṇḍita prepared a garland from those kadamba flowers and offered it to Nityānanda. Shortly thereafter, the ten directions were suddenly filled with the aroma of damanaka (Artemisia indica) flowers, and Nityānanda explained that Śrī Gaurasundara had put on a garland of damanaka flowers and come from Nīlācala to hear the kīrtana. Then Nityānanda and His associates all manifested transformations of ecstatic love. Śrī Nityānanda stayed in Pānihāṭi for three months and exhibited various pastimes of devotional service. Lord Nityānanda Prabhu used to decorate His body with various ornaments. Along with His associates, Nityānanda visited the houses of the devotees situated on both sides of the Ganges. The children were showered with His mercy.\n\nOne day Śrī Nityānanda went to the house of Śrī Gadādhara dāsa. In the course of this narration there is a description of Śrī Gadādhara Dāsa’s eternal mood as a gopī. Śrī Nityānanda took the Bāla-gopāla Deity from Śrī Dāsa Gadādhara Prabhu’s temple and embraced put Him to His chest. When Śrī Nityānanda heard Śrī Mādhavānanda’s song describing the dāna-khaṇḍa-līlā, the pastimes of taking taxes, symptoms of ecstatic love manifested in His body. In Gadādhara dāsa’s village lived one Kazi, who was very envious, cruel, and opposed to kīrtana. One day while intoxicated by love of God, Dāsa Gadādhara Prabhu fearlessly went at night to the house of the Kazi while chanting the name of Hari and said, “Where is that fellow Kazi? He better chant the name of Kṛṣṇa quickly, or I will break his head.” When the Kazi came before Dāsa Gadādhara and asked why he was coming to the house of an atheist like him, Dāsa Gadādhara replied, “During the incarnation of Śrī Caitanya and Nityānanda everyone in the world has chanted the name of Kṛṣṇa, only you have remained aloof. I have come to make you chant the name of Hari.” The Kazi replied, “Gadādhara, you go home today, I will chant the name of Hari tomorrow.” On hearing the Kazi say the name Hari, Gadādhara said, “Why tomorrow? You have already chanted the name of Hari.” At this point the author describes various wonderful symptoms of love of God manifested by the associates of Śrī Nityānanda. Thereafter Nityānanda with His associates departed for Navadvīpa to see Mother Śacī, and on the way they stayed at Purandara Paṇḍita’s temple in Khaḍadaha. While describing at this point the most wonderful transformations of loving devotional service manifested by Śrī Caitanya’s servant Murāri Paṇḍita, the author then refutes the sinful activities of the so-called servants of Śrī Caitanya who independently identify themselves with pride as followers of Śrī Advaita. After spending a few days at Khaḍadaha, Śrī Nityānanda and His associates went to the village of Saptagrāma and took bath there at the Triveṇī bathing ghāṭa on the banks of the Ganges. He stayed on the bank at the Triveṇī in the house of Uddhāraṇa Datta, and He inspired the entire mercantile community to worship Kṛṣṇa by preaching the holy names of Kṛṣṇa from door to door. Even godless Yavanas took shelter at the lotus feet of Śrī Nityānanda, the deliverer of the fallen souls.\n\nAfter some time Śrī Nityānanda came to Śrī Advaita’s house in Śāntipura. Śrī Advaita Ācārya offered prayers to Nityānanda Prabhu, and then the two spent the entire day in great ecstasy discussing topics of Kṛṣṇa. From Śāntipura, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu went to Navadvīpa and went straight to Śrīdhāma Māyāpur to meet Mother Śacī. Śrī Nityānanda and His associates enjoyed ecstatic kīrtana pastimes in Navadvīpa and enacted pastimes of delivering the fallen souls. In this connection the author describes an incident involving a dacoit of Navadvīpa. In Navadvīpa there was a particular young brāhmaṇa, who was the leader of the dacoits. That leader of dacoits saw the opulent ornaments on the body of Śrī Nityānanda and desired to steal them. Thinking in this way, he began to travel with Nityānanda with a desire to steal His ornaments. Realizing that Śrī Nityānanda was living alone at the house of Hiraṇya Paṇḍita, that leader of dacoits along with his fellow dacoits waited at night fully prepared in a solitary place near the house of Hiraṇya Paṇḍita. They began to contemplate who would take which ornament of Nityānanda. But by the will of Śrī Nityānanda, the dacoits soon fell asleep. When they woke early the next morning to the sound of the crows, they hastily hid their weapons at some place and returned to their respective home while blaming each other. On the next night the dacoits first worshiped goddess Caṇḍī with great pomp by offering her wine and flesh, and after collecting various weapons and wearing kavacas, or protective amulets, they surrounded the house of Nityānanda at the dead of night. But contrary to their expectations they found innumerable, fully prepared, fierce-looking soldiers who were constantly chanting the name of Hari were guarding the house of Nityānanda. They became greatly astonished to see this and after making various arguments among themselves they concluded that there is no hope of their success on that particular night and left. When on the third night the dacoits entered into the residence of Śrī Nityānanda, they immediately lost their sight and started falling into filthy pits and thorny bushes. At that moment Lord Indra began to shower heavy rain and storm there by making the lives of the dacoits miserable. After this incident the leader of the dacoits had a change of heart, so he took shelter at the lotus feet of Nityānanda and prayed for his own deliverance while offering prayers to Nityānanda. Śrī Nityānanda bestowed mercy on the leader of the dacoits by forbidding him to again engage in sinful activities while misusing his independence. Moreover, Śrī Nityānanda delivered other dacoits through this leader of the dacoits. In this connection the author describes the glories of Nityānanda’s mercy, His preaching of the holy names throughout Navadvīpa, His frequent visits to Kulīyā on the other side of the Ganges, the characteristics of Śrī Nityānanda’s associates, a brief introduction of some of Nityānanda’s associates, and himself as the last servant of Nityānanda and the son of Nārāyaṇī devī, a recipient of Caitanya’s mercy.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 5.001\n\nTEXT 1\n\njaya jaya śrī-gaurasundara sarva-gurujaya jaya bhakta-jana-vāñchā-kalpa-taru\n\nAll glories to Śrī Gaurasundara, the spiritual master of everyone!

His idea was that Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya was Rādhikā and Advaita was Kṛṣṇa. But actually Lord Caitanya is the combined form of Rādhā and Govinda, and Śrī Advaita Prabhu is a devotee of Lord Caitanya. This so-called servant of Lord Caitanya was actually averse to Lord Caitanya. Śrī Advaita Prabhu became fully empowered simply by the mercy of Lord Caitanya. Yet that ativāḍī, or overly proud person, who considered himself a devotee of Advaita did not realize this fact and thought that such a statement was an insult to Śrī Advaita.

Therefore to call oneself Caitanya dāsa is simply a method of deceiving people. Those who do not understand the deep meaning of the phrase puṇya-jana consider that it has a good connotation, but in actuality it is used to give the opposite meaning. Similarly, if names like Caitanya dāsa are not indicative of the actual meaning but are used to indicate an offender of Lord Caitanya, then the person with such a name can never become an actual servant of Lord Caitanya.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 5.443\n\nTEXT 443\n\nkata-dine thāki’ nityānanda khaḍadahesaptagrāma āilena sarva-gaṇa-sahe\n\nAfter passing some days at Khaḍadaha, Nityānanda went with His associates to Saptagrāma.\n\nFor an elaborate description of Saptagrāma, see the Anubhāṣya commentary on Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līlā, Chapter Eleven, text 41.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 5.444\n\nTEXT 444\n\nsei saptagrāme āche-sapta-ṛṣi-sthānajagate vidita se ’triveṇī-ghāṭa’ nāma\n\nIn this village of Saptagrāma there is a place associated with the seven sages known throughout the world as Triveṇī-ghāṭa.\n\nThe confluence of the Ganges, Sarasvatī, and Yamunā is known as Triveṇī even today.

In some cases, however, a punished person commits the same sin for which he had undergone punishment. When there is no longer a propensity for committing further sin, a person desires to be relieved of the reactions for the sins he has committed. If that desire is sincere, then there is no possibility of reviving the propensity to commit sin. But if one is not completely free from sin, then the seed of sin naturally induces one to engage again in sinful activities. As a bankrupt person unable to repay his debts is given a fresh opportunity to repay his debts under a formula prescribed by the judge, the mind of one who is inclined to lead a pious life by giving up desires to commit sinful activities like harming others does not run after sin.

Many people who did not understand his actual position misunderstood him as an ahaṅgrahopāsaka, or one who worships himself as the Supreme. Actually Rāmadāsa was always eager to gratify the senses of the Supreme Lord. Since foolish Māyāvādīs consider the living entities and the Supreme Brahman as one, they cannot understand the endeavors of the devotees. Once Śrī Rāmadāsa concealed his mood as a servant and Kṛṣṇa entered his body and resided there for three months. If one takes advantage of this incident and independently acts like Kṛṣṇa, his attainment of hell is guaranteed.

Even though that brāhmaṇa had firm faith in the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya, he developed some doubt in Nityānanda Prabhu’ s behavior, which was beyond Vedic rules and regulations. This brāhmaṇa went one time to Nīlācala and secretly revealed to Śrīman Mahāprabhu his doubts about Śrī Nityānanda. He said that everyone calls Nityānanda a sannyāsī, and a sannyāsī is prohibited to touch any object made of metal; but Nityānanda is always decorated with various gold, silver, and jewel-studded ornaments; He wears fine silk cloth rather than saffron loincloth; He carries an iron rod rather than a daṇḍa; He always stays and eats at the houses of śūdras; and as such His behavior is not seen to be in accordance with the śāstras. Why should a person who is accepted by everyone as a great personality act in a way that is contrary to the principles of āśrama?\n\nTo remove the doubts of that brāhmaṇa, Mahāprabhu quoted evidence from Śrīmad Bhāgavatam to establish that the faults seen through mundane vision in uttama-adhikārī Vaiṣṇavas are not actually faults. Lord Kṛṣṇacandra is supremely independent, and as such He constantly resides and enjoys pastimes within the body of the uttama-adhikārī Vaiṣṇava. Therefore all activities of an uttama-adhikārī are meant for Kṛṣṇa’s pleasure. This is possible only for a nonduplicitous uttama-adhikārī Vaiṣṇava. Only Rudra can drink poison and be addressed as Nīlakaṇṭha; it is not possible for others. By imitating the activities and behavior of an uttama-adhikārī, one’s destruction is inevitable. In this regard Śrī Gaurasundara quoted two verses from the Tenth Canto of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam as evidence. He also described an incident from the Eighty-fifth Chapter of the Tenth Canto of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam as an example of how severely one has to suffer and take birth in sinful species of life if he even makes comments on the external so-called sinful activities of nonduplicitous exalted personalities. When even perfected personalities can suffer unlimited miseries and fall into the pit of karma by ridiculing the behavior of a transcendental mahā-bhāgavata Vaiṣṇava, then what can be said about ordinary people? The worship and pretension of chanting the holy names performed by a person who worships Viṣṇu and chants the holy name (?) of Hari but blasphemes the devotees of Hari are all useless. And a person who engages with love and devotion in the service of the devotees of the Supreme Lord can undoubtedly attain the service of Kṛṣṇa. A person who makes a show of worshiping Viṣṇu but disregards the worship of a Vaiṣṇava is a proud person. The characteristics of the supremely independent Śrī Nityānanda, who is nondifferent from Baladeva, are incomprehensible and inconceivable to ordinary living entities. They are beyond all rules and regulations. If anyone even unknowingly blasphemes Nityānanda, he will fall down forever even after achieving the devotional service of Viṣṇu.\n\nTo inform everyone of these instructions, Śrī Gaurasundara immediately sent that brāhmaṇa to Navadvīpa.\n\nŚrī Gaurasundara said, “Anyone who has unflinching love for Nityānanda certainly has love for Me also. Of this, there is no doubt. Being nondifferent from Baladeva, Śrī Nityānanda is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even if He ever appears to drink wine or associate with women, He is eternally worshipable for Lord Brahmā.”\n\nAfter hearing these words from Śrī Mahāprabhu, the doubts of that brāhmaṇa were destroyed and he developed faith in the lotus feet of Śrī Nityānanda. The brāhmaṇa went to Navadvīpa and immediately begged forgiveness for his offences from Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu and thus attained His mercy.\n\nIn conclusion, Ṭhākura Vṛndāvana explains that even if different people from different statuses of life say anything about Śrī Nityānanda, if a living entity somehow or other takes shelter of Nityānanda and Gauracandra, then, as a worshiper of the spiritual master and Gaurāṅga, that person certainly becomes worshipable to the author. “Nityānanda alone is my eternal master, and I am His eternal servant, birth after birth. I beg everyone for servitorship to Nityānanda. If, in spite of Śrī Nityānanda’s matchless glories, a person blasphemes Him, then there is no possibility of auspiciousness for that person other than a kick from the lotus feet of Nityānanda’s servants.” The author concludes this chapter by describing the service of Śrī Nitāi-Gaura along with Their associates and attributes.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 6.001\n\nTEXT 1\n\njaya jaya gauracandra jaya nityānandajaya jaya prabhura yateka bhakta-vṛnda\n\nAll glories to Gauracandra!

Then again, the intelligent persons who considered that giving up objects related to Hari was phalgu-vairāgya, or false renunciation, took pleasure in Nityānanda Prabhu’s preaching.\n\nAccording to the injunctions of the scriptures, a sannyāsī is prohibited from accepting objects of enjoyment like scented oil, sandalwood paste, and betel nuts, but the precocious, proud, prākṛta-sahajiyās freely enjoy an abundance of betel nuts on the pretext of honoring prasāda. Since the imitation of paramahaṁsa behavior by such unqualified people is always condemnable, ordinary foolish people fell into illusion by considering even Śrī Nityānanda, the original shelter of paramahaṁsa principles, as a vivikta (dry renunciant) or a dhīra-sannyāsī (neophyte sannyāsī).\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 6.018\n\nTEXT 18\n\ndhātu-dravya paraśite nāhi sannyāsīresonā, rūpā, muktā se tāṅhāra kalevare\n\n“A sannyāsī is prohibited from touching items made of metal, but His body is decorated with gold, silver, and pearls.\n\nThe prākṛta-sahajiyās say that at the present time Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa dāsa has protected the honor of the sannyāsa-āśrama by refusing to accept items made of metal. A devotee sannyāsī should not use gold and silver like Śrī Nityānanda. There is no doubt that the principles of the independent Vedic sannyāsī become polluted by using these items, but if one internally considers himself a paramahaṁsa and externally does not use items made of metal, the desire for fame will capture his heart and, as a result of cheating people, such behavior will be accepted as low-class.\n\nIf one refrains from using items made of metal during processions and festivals because people will criticize, and if one displays poverty in the performance of the Lord’s service, then the misguided, materialistic philanthropists will not be able to understand the purport of the verse beginning ārādhanānāṁ sarveṣāṁ. If in the present day one gives up saffron loincloth and becomes misguided by wearing fine silk cloth and decorating his body with sandalwood paste and flower garlands, then, as a result of imitating the behavior of paramahaṁsas, he will bring about his own ruination.

If as a result of committing offenses described in verses like arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīr, one sees Lord Viṣṇu as equal to other personalities, then he is certain to go to hell. People who are puffed-up with false ego and cheated by mundane knowledge bring about their own ruination by seeing them through external vision as equal. As a result, they fall from the lotus feet of Gopīnātha. What to speak of this, they even fall from the lotus feet of Āloyārnātha. When a person loses the good fortune of serving Āloyārnātha, he begins to worship the Jagannātha of the pañcopāsakas. While worshiping Jagannātha, he fixes his mind in the worship of Bhuvaneśvara. Thereafter, when he commits offense at the feet of Bhuvaneśvara, the best of the devotees, he develops the propensity to perform pious activities. As a result, the desire awakens in him to take bath in and perform fruitive activities at the Vaitaraṇī River in Yājapura. When he falls from pious activities and begins to commit sinful activities, he becomes ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā, or bewildered by false ego, and the sense of considering himself the doer distracts him from the path of spiritual life. When he further increases his offenses, he becomes averse to seeing the beauty of Śrī Gopīnātha’s lotus feet. Therefore, those who have not discussed the purport of the Vedic statement: nāyam ātmā bala-hīnena (“One cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balarāma”) are inevitably degraded.

It is impossible for a person who has no love for the lotus feet of Śrī Guru and Vaiṣṇava to attain Kṛṣṇa’s mercy. Love for one’s fellow human beings and service to the conditioned souls cannot attract the Supreme Lord’s love. The conditional knowledge of a living entity is dispelled only by the influence of service to Śrī Guru and Vaiṣṇava. As a result of the knowledge of one’s relationship to Kṛṣṇa that the spiritual master imparts in their ears, the conditioned souls develop love for Śrī Hari, Guru, and Vaiṣṇava and engage in their eternal service. On that platform, the spirit of material enjoyment cannot attack them. The taste that sinful people develop by accepting misconceptions about so-called gurus and the Supreme Lord, the original shelter, is completely separate from the eternal truth and is simply illusion. That is why Śrī Gaurasundara used the word satya three times.

It is not proper for the Lord’s devotees to have any relationship with those who associate with any atheist envious of Nityānanda, whose body is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa. The qualification to serve the lotus feet of the spiritual master diminishes by the influence of bad association. Therefore one should never act in a way that will disrupt remembrance of one’s spiritual master, who is the unalloyed eternal servant of Śrī Gaurasundara and whose body is nondifferent from Śrī Gaurasundara. Those who use spiritual life for material gain are not devotees but servants of sense gratification. A so-called devotee and a devotee have completely opposite characteristics. That is why it is very unfortunate to consider those who indulge in materialistic association as members of a spiritual society. When one invites his own destruction, he becomes deprived of spiritual life and considers the spiritual master, who is nondifferent from Nityānanda, as separate from Śrī Nityānanda, the prakāśa-vigraha of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya. Such people can never attain the service of Śrī Gaurasundara. They suffer perpetually because of disrespecting their guru.\n\nThe path currently pursued by some completely duplicitous so-called devotees opposed to Śrī Gauḍīya Maṭha will result in inauspiciousness.

When Śrī Gaurasundara came alone to that garden to meet Śrī Nityānanda, the Lord offered prayers to Nityānanda by reciting the śloka beginning gṛnhīyād yavanī pānin and then circumambulated Him. Śrī Nityānanda also manifested ecstatic love upon seeing the moonlike face of Śrī Gaura. A current of great ecstasy swelled in the loving conversation between Śrī Caitanya and Nityānanda. While glorifying Śrī Nityānanda, Śrīman Mahāprabhu said that the gold, silver, pearls, rudrākṣa, etc., that are found on Śrī Nityānanda’s body are the nine types of devotional service. Śrī Nityānanda has awarded to even fallen souls the most rare loving devotional service that is desired by even great sages and mystic yogis, and Nityānanda is capable of giving away even Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is supremely independent. Nityānanda is the personification of the mellows of devotional service to Kṛṣṇa, and the body of Nityānanda is the abode of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes. Śrī Nityānanda also revealed His own subordinate nature to Śrī Gaurasundara.\n\nMahāprabhu said that the nine types of devotional service certainly adorn the transcendental limbs of Śrī Nityānanda as His ornaments. As ordinary people who do not understand why Lord Śiva decorates his head with a snake imagine or think differently about him, similarly, on seeing the ornaments on Śrī Nityānanda’s transcendental body, people proud of their material knowledge become offenders at His lotus feet. Lord Śiva is the servant of Śrī Saṅkarṣaṇa, or Śrī Ananta, so out of love for his worshipable Lord, Śiva always keeps Śrī Ananta on his head. Similarly, for the pleasure of Śrī Gaurasundara, Śrī Nityānanda also decorates His transcendental body with the ornaments of the nine types of devotional service. Fortunate persons can understand these confidential topics, and thus they become happy and attain service at the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Sinful people, however, become destroyed by being deceived by their material knowledge. Śrī Nityānanda and His associates are Śrī Baladeva and Baladeva’s associates of Vraja. The devotional sentiments enjoyed by the associates of Nanda Mahārāja are present on the transcendental body of Śrī Nityānanda as His ornaments.\n\nŚrī Caitanya and Śrī Nityānanda sat in that solitary flower garden and discussed confidential topics and the rare transcendental sentiments of Gokula desired by personalities like Śrī Uddhava. In this regard the author glorifies the supreme position of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya and warns about the grave consequences a person faces if, without understanding the confidential loving quarrels between Śrī Nityānanda and Śrī Gauracandra, he takes the side of one Lord and blasphemes the other Lord.\n\nAfter taking leave from Nityānanda, Śrī Gaurasundara returned to His own residence. Śrī Nityānanda went to see Lord Jagannātha, where He manifested pastimes of mahābhāva, and from there He went to the house of Śrī Gadādhara Paṇḍita in one garden. The Deity of Gopīnātha was situated in the house of Gadādhara. This Deity is so attractive that even the hearts of atheists become melted on seeing Him. Śrī Caitanyadeva personally embraced this Deity. When Śrī Gadādhara heard the news of Śrī Nityānanda’s arrival at his house, he left his recitation of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam and came to greet Him. During their meeting, they both became overwhelmed with love while glorifying each other. Neither of them would ever converse with the other’s enemy. Gadādhara resolved that he would never see the face of a person who blasphemes Nityānanda.\n\nŚrī Gadādhara Paṇḍita invited Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu to have lunch at his house, and Śrī Nityānanda gave Gadādhara Paṇḍita some fine rice fit for offering the Lord that He had personally brought from Bengal for offering to Gopīnātha. He also presented a beautiful colored cloth to Gopīnātha. Gadādhara put that colored cloth on the transcendental body of Śrī Gopīnātha. He then cooked the rice that Nityānanda had brought from Bengal and offered it to Gopīnātha along with vegetables and a preparation of spinach picked from the courtyard of the Ṭoṭā-gopīnātha temple.\n\nAt that time Śrī Gaurasundara also arrived at Gadādhara’s house and told Gadādhara that He was certainly entitled to a portion of Nityānanda’s goods, Gadādhara’s cooking, and Gopīnātha’s remnants. On hearing Śrī Mahāprabhu’s merciful words, Gadādhara became extremely happy, and he placed a plate of Gopīnātha’s prasāda before Mahāprabhu. While honoring the rice given by Nityānanda and while praising the cooking of Gadādhara, Mahāprabhu manifested the pastime of honoring Gopīnātha’s prasāda. Śrī Gaurasundara, Nityānanda, and Gadādhara finished their pastime of honoring prasāda in the midst of laughing and teasing each other. Then the devotees gathered there plundered the remnants of the three Prabhus.\n\nṬhākura Vṛndāvana concludes this chapter by declaring that one who hears or reads about Śrī Gaura-Nityānanda’s pastime of eating at the house of Gadādhara will attain devotional service and by describing topics of Gaura, Gadādhara, and Nityānanda’s living together in Nīlācala.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 7.001\n\nTEXT 1\n\njaya jaya śrī-vaikuṇṭha-nātha gauracandrajaya jaya śrī-sevā-vigraha nityānanda\n\nAll glories to Śrī Gauracandra, the Lord of Vaikuṇṭha!

He also describes Śrī Advaita Ācārya and other devotees’ arrival in Nīlācala with their wives, sons, servants, and maidservants; Mahāprabhu’s going to Āṭhāranālā to receive Śrī Advaita Ācārya; Balarāma, Kṛṣṇa, and Govinda’ s arrival at the lake called Narendra-sarovara for the Candana-yātrā ceremony; the Lord’s watching the Candana-yātrā festival along with the devotees from Bengal; the Lord’s performance of water sports in Narendra-sarovara; the Lord’s taking darśana of Lord Jagannātha; Mahāprabhu’s pastime of setting the example of serving tulasī; Śrī Advaita Ācārya’s glorification of Mahāprabhu’s associates and their unique position; and the transcendental position of the Vaiṣṇavas.\n\nWhen the time for Lord Jagannātha’s Ratha-yātrā festival came closer, the devotees from Bengal left for Nīlācala to see the Ratha-yātrā festival under the order of Śrīman Mahāprabhu. Paṇḍita Śrīvāsa, Śrī Candraśekhara, Paṇḍita Gadādhara dāsa, Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi, Paṇḍita Vakreśvara, Pradyumna Brahmacārī, Ṭhākura Haridāsa, Vāsudeva Datta Ṭhākura, Śrī Mukunda Datta Ṭhākura, Śivānanda Sena, Govindānanda, the scribe Vijaya dāsa, Sadāśiva Paṇḍita, Puruṣottama Sañjaya, Nandana Ācārya, Śuklāmbara Brahmacārī, Śrīdhara, Bhagavān Paṇḍita, Gopīnātha Paṇḍita, Śrīgarbha Paṇḍita, Vanamālī Paṇḍita, Jagadiśa and Hiraṇya Paṇḍita, Buddhimanta Khān, Ācārya Purandara, Murāri Gupta, Garuḍa Paṇḍita, Gopīnātha Siṁha, Śrī Rāma Paṇḍita, Nārāyaṇa Paṇḍita, Paṇḍita Dāmodara who had gone to see Mother Śacī, and Śrī Advaita Prabhu took various eatables that were dear to the Lord and journeyed with their wives, sons, servants, maidservants, and relatives to Nīlācala while chanting the holy names of Kṛṣṇa along the way. At Kamalapura the devotees saw the flag on top of the Jagannātha temple and offered their respectful obeisances.\n\nMahāprabhu could understand that the devotees from Bengal headed by Śrī Advaita were coming, so He had sent Jagannātha mahā-prasāda all the way to Cuttack to welcome them and He personally led the devotees of Nīlācala to Āṭhāranālā to greet the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas. As the devotees of Bengal headed by Śrī Advaita and the devotees of Nīlācala headed by Śrī Gaurasundara met each other at Āṭhāranālā, their great ecstasy swelled and overflowed like the confluence of the Ganges and the ocean. Then, keeping Śrī Mahāprabhu in front, the Śrī Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas went to the banks of Narendra-sarovara while performing saṅkīrtana and dancing in ecstasy. Since by the arrangement of providence the Candana-yātrā, or boat festival of Śrī Rāma-Kṛṣṇa-Govinda, fell on that day, the devotees from Bengal and the devotees from Nīlācala together performed a huge kīrtana. On seeing the boat festival of Śrī Rāma-Kṛṣṇa-Govinda, Mahāprabhu jumped into the water of Narendra-sarovara with the devotees and performed various water sports.\n\nAlthough all kinds of people such as materialists, sannyāsīs, and brahmacārīs engaged in swimming in the waters of Narendra lake during the boat festival of Śrī Rāma-Kṛṣṇa-Govinda, by the influence of Śrī Caitanya’s illusory energy, they could not come anywhere near Śrī Caitanya or His devotees. Śrī Caitanya’s mercy is obtainable only by unmotivated service attitude. It is not possible to associate with Śrī Caitanya and His devotees or see their pastimes through education, wealth, or austerities. Not understanding the transcendental glories of chanting of the holy name of Hari, the proud Māyāvādī sannyāsīs fall down by regularly blaspheming Śrī Caitanyadeva for failing to study Vedānta, practice prāṇāyāma, or execute duties befitting a sannyāsī. Although some exalted sannyāsīs glorify Śrī Caitanyadeva as a mahājana, some consider Him a learned scholar, and some consider Him a great devotee, they are unable to understand the actual identity of Śrī Caitanya. Since Gaurasundara, who is nondifferent from the son of the King of Vraja, and His devotees, who are nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa’s associates of Vraja, engaged in water sports in Narendra-sarovara, the waters of Narendra became as fortunate as the rivers Yamunā and Ganges.\n\nAfter completing their water sports in Narendra, Śrīman Mahāprabhu along with His devotees went to the Jagannātha temple to see Lord Jagannātha. On seeing both moving and stationary Jagannātha together, the devotees offered repeated obeisances to Them. Kāśī Miśra greeted all the devotees with remnants of Lord Jagannātha’s garland. The Lord, enacting the pastime of an instructing spiritual master, displayed the pastime of accepting the remnants of Jagannātha’s garland. Śrīman Mahāprabhu alone knows the glories of serving the Vaiṣṇavas, tulasī, the Ganges, and mahā-prasāda. Mahāprabhu therefore taught Vaiṣṇavas the principles of devotional service by exhibiting the pastime of offering obeisances to the swanlike Vaiṣṇavas. The renounced order of life is the topmost among the āśramas. If the son of a person takes sannyāsa, then even the formerly respectable father of that son must offer his son respects. In the same way, Mahāprabhu, the all-respectable Supreme Lord engaged in pastimes as a sannyāsī, used to display the pastime of offering respect to the Vaiṣṇavas in order to reveal the supremacy of the swanlike Vaiṣṇavas.\n\nMahāprabhu’s pastimes of worshiping tulasī were unique. The Lord would fill a small pot with choice dirt and plant tulasī in it. Then whenever the Lord would walk in the street chanting the name of Hari, someone would walk with that potted tulasī in front of the Lord. Thus the Lord would chant the holy name while seeing and following tulasī. Whenever Mahāprabhu would sit down and chant, He would place tulasī by His side so that He could see her while chanting the holy name. Śrīman Mahāprabhu declared that He could not live without seeing tulasī as a fish cannot live out of water. Only those who, rather than imitate, sincerely follow śikṣā-guru Nārāyaṇa’s teachings under the guidance of the spiritual master and the Vaiṣṇavas are delivered from the hands of inauspiciousness.\n\nAfter taking darśana of Lord Jagannātha, Śrī Mahāprabhu returned to His residence with the devotees. The Lord, who is like a desire tree for the devotees, would satisfy the devotees according to their respective desires. Mahāprabhu always kept the devotees with Him, showing them affection as one would his own son, and the devotees also constantly remained absorbed in the blissful service of the Lord. The devotees from Bengal and Nīlācala lived together and engaged in kṛṣṇa-kīrtana without consideration of caste or place of birth. By the mercy of Śrī Caitanyadeva, everyone received an opportunity to see the Vaiṣṇavas from Śvetadvīpa. Śrī Advaita Ācārya repeatedly said with His own mouth that only by the mercy of Śrī Caitanya did He also have the opportunity to see those exalted Vaiṣṇavas, whom even the demigods are unable to see. The Vaiṣṇavas are actually the Supreme Lord’s eternal associates, who accompany the Lord when He descends in this world. Just as Lord Vāsudeva appears with Pradyumna, Aniruddha, and Saṅkarṣaṇa, and as Lord Rāmacandra appears with Lakṣmaṇa, Bharata, and Śatrughna, similarly, these Vaiṣṇavas appear by the order of Mahāprabhu to assist the Lord in His pastimes.\n\nTherefore the birth and pastimes enjoyed by Vaiṣṇavas are not the fruits of their karma. By the Lord’s will the Vaiṣṇavas appear in this world to assist the Lord in His pastimes, and by the Lord’s will they disappear from this world.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 8.001\n\nTEXT 1\n\njaya jaya mahāprabhu śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanyajaya jaya nityānanda tribhuvana-dhanya\n\nAll glories to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu!

In this case it is understood that the Lord chanted a fixed number of names while sitting next to a tulasī plant. Śrī Gaurasundara exhibited the pastime of associating with keśava-priyā tulasī to teach those who do not consider the association of kṛṣṇa-priyā tulasī as favorable to devotional service but rather accept her as an ordinary plant.

One day Advaita Prabhu invited Mahāprabhu for lunch and personally cooked for the Lord. Advaita’s wife assisted Him by making all the arrangements for cooking. Śrī Advaita Ācārya had the desire to feed Mahāprabhu alone to His heart’s satisfaction and suddenly, by the arrangement of providence, the sannyāsīs who usually ate with the Lord were separated from Him. Thus Mahāprabhu went alone to the house of Advaita and fulfilled His desire. Since Indra assisted Advaita Ācārya in His discharge of devotional service to Kṛṣṇa by sending a storm and rain, Advaita Ācārya began to offer Indra prayers, considering him a servant of Kṛṣṇa. Understanding Advaita Ācārya’s heart, Mahāprabhu glorified Advaita by saying that it was not at all astonishing that Indra would follow the order of one whose resolution even Lord Kṛṣṇa was bound to fulfill. The so-called followers of Advaita who rather than accept Śrī Advaita Ācārya’s subordination to Śrī Caitanya think otherwise are not fit to be seen by Advaita Ācārya.\n\nWhen Dāmodara Paṇḍita returned from Bengal and Mahāprabhu asked him about Mother Śacī’s devotional service to Viṣṇu, the impartial Dāmodara glorified Mother Śacī as mūrtimatī viṣṇu-bhakti, the embodiment of devotional service to Lord Viṣṇu, and described the glories of the word āi. Mahāprabhu, who was performing the pastimes of teaching ordinary people, asked Dāmodara such a question just to teach ordinary people. Inquiries about one’s devotional service to Kṛṣṇa are proper inquiries about someone’s well-being. Devotees of Viṣṇu are certainly wealthy. Mahāprabhu let everyone know that He would not eat at anyone’s house unless that person chants one hundred thousand names of Hari. Therefore, for the sake of feeding Mahāprabhu, many devotees began to chant one hundred thousand names of Hari.\n\nOne day when Mahāprabhu asked Śrī Keśava Bhārati whether jñāna or devotional service was superior, Bhāratipāda replied that devotional service was certainly superior; because exalted personalities like Brahmā, Śiva, Nārada, Prahlāda, Śukadeva, Vyāsa, the four Kumāras, the Pāṇḍavas headed by Yudhiṣṭhira, Prīyavrata, Pṛthu, Dhruva, Akrūra, and Uddhava have all prayed for devotional service at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. Some of them even begged for devotional service after giving up their previous attachment for jñāna. Therefore the path of devotional service approved by the mahājanas is the ultimate goal for all living entities and for all time. After hearing the words of Bhārati, Mahāprabhu expressed His pleasure and began to dance in ecstasy.\n\nOne day when under the order of Śrī Advaita Ācārya all the devotees began to glorify the names, qualities, and pastimes of the incarnation of Lord Caitanya, the Ācārya began to dance and roar loudly. The Ācārya began to dance with the devotees while chanting a song He personally composed about Lord Caitanya. When Mahāprabhu heard the sound of kīrtana and came there, the devotees under the leadership of Advaita Ācārya began to glorify Lord Caitanya’s names, forms, qualities, and pastimes even more enthusiastically. To protect the mission of His covered incarnation, Mahāprabhu, who is the teacher of all living entities and who accepted the mood of a devotee, left that place and returned to His residence to enact the pastime of going to bed in an angry mood. The devotees headed by Śrīvāsa went to the Lord’s residence, and Mahāprabhu indicated that His identity in His covered incarnation was to remain concealed. In response, Śrīvāsa made a gesture of trying to cover the sun with his two hands to show that by covering a self-manifested object it could never remain hidden. In fact, even if it were possible to cover the sun with one’s hands, it was not possible for Lord Caitanya to remain hidden, for His glories were spread throughout the entire world. At that time, innumerable devotees from various provinces suddenly arrived there glorifying the names, forms, qualities, and pastimes of the incarnation of Śrī Caitanya and thereby substantiated the words of Śrīvāsa. As a result, Mahāprabhu enhanced the glories of His devotee by accepting defeat.\n\nThe science of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya’s position as the origin of all incarnations is accepted through disciplic succession. When He is accepted by personalities like Śrī Advaita and Śrī Nityānanda as the source of all incarnations, and when He exhibits the special characteristics found only in Lord Kṛṣṇa, then to not accept Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead but to consider Him as something else is nothing but atheism.\n\nWhen Śrī Rūpa and Sanātana came before Mahāprabhu and expressed their humility, Mahāprabhu glorified their renunciation and instructed them to take shelter of the lotus feet of Śrī Advaita Ācārya to obtain loving devotional service. When Mahāprabhu said that Advaita Ācārya was the storekeeper of devotional service, the Ācārya replied that Mahāprabhu was actually the proprietor of that storehouse, and the storekeeper is allowed to give out goods only under the order of the proprietor. In other words, He revealed His subordination to Mahāprabhu. Mahāprabhu ordered Śrī Rūpa and Sanātana to go to Mathurā-maṇḍala and deliver the people of the western countries from the clutches of sinful activities and improper behavior by preaching pure devotional service. Then Mahāprabhu awarded Sākara Mallika the spiritual name Sanātana.\n\nWhen Mahāprabhu inquired from Śrīvāsa about the Vaiṣṇava status of Advaita, Śrīvāsa said that Śrī Advaita Ācārya was a Vaiṣṇava in the category of Śukadeva and Prahlāda. This caused Mahāprabhu to manifest His pastime of anger. In that angry mood the Lord picked up a fishing rod and was about to beat Śrīvāsa. The Lord then revealed that Śrī Advaita was the primeval Lord, the source of all ingredients, the Supersoul of everyone, and the incarnation of Mahā-Viṣṇu; therefore, compared to Him, personalities like Śukadeva and Prahlāda were nothing but children. The exalted author then proves the inconceivable and unique behavior of the perfected Vaiṣṇavas by relating the incident of Bhṛgu described in the Tenth Canto of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam. He concludes this chapter by saying that only by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa and by taking shelter of Kṛṣṇa can one realize the difficult to comprehend characteristics of the Vaiṣṇavas.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 9.001\n\nTEXT 1\n\njaya jaya śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya ramā-kāntajaya sarva-vaiṣṇavera vallabha ekānta\n\nAll glories to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, the husband of the goddess of fortune!

Except Śrī Kṛṣṇa, all the demigods hold the Ganges water on their heads. The Ganges cannot emanate from the feet of any demigod. To attain the lotus feet of Śrī Gaurasundara, Gaṅgādevī induced common people to give up the observance of the Śrī Vaiṣṇavas from the Rāmānuja-sampradāya and take bath in the Ganges, because Śrī Gaurasundara followed the local tradition and took bath in the Jāhnavī, who emanated from His lotus feet.\n\nSee the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (9.4.63-68 and 1.9.37).

Vāsudeva then saw the newborn child, who had very wonderful lotus-like eyes and who bore in His four hands the four weapons śaṅkha, cakra, gadā, and padma. On His chest was the mark of Śrīvatsa and on His neck the brilliant Kaustubha gem.”\n\nIn the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (10.3.13) it is stated:\n\nvidito ’si bhavān sākṣāt   puruṣaḥ prakṛteḥ paraḥ\n\n“Now I can understand that You are the Supreme Person, beyond material existence.”\n\nIn the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (10.66.13-14) it is stated:\n\nśaṅkhāry-asi-gadā-śārṅga-   śrīvatsādy-upalakṣitambibhrāṇaṁ kaustubha-maṇiṁ   vana-mālā-vibhūṣitam\n\nkauśeya-vāsasī pīte   vasānaṁ garuḍa-dhvajamamūlya-mauly-ābharaṇaṁ   sphuran-makara-kuṇḍalam\n\n“He carried the conchshell, disc, sword, club, and Śārṅga bow.

Like the sun-god, He pervades everything by the rays of His energy. He appears impersonal to imperfect eyes.” One can understand the science of Lord Viṣṇu only on the strength of one’s sincere worship of Gaurasundara. The words of Gaurasundara are certainly equal to Vedic statements. Misunderstanding of the independent Vedic statements disturbs and misdirects the limited knowledge of humans. Just as the science of the Supreme Lord is incomprehensible, the science of the Vaiṣṇavas is incomprehensible to ordinary people.\n\nIn the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad (3.1.7) it is stated:\n\nbṛhac ca tad divyam acintya-rūpaṁsūkṣmāc ca tat sūkṣmataraṁ vibhātidūrāt sa-dūre tad ihānti ke capaśyatsv ihaiva nihitaṁ guhāyām\n\n“The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the greatest.

And because all of us are bewildered by the illusory external energy of the Supreme Lord, we can see only this manifested cosmos according to our individual ability.”\n\nIn the Śrīmad Bhāgavatam (6.17.32 and 35) it is stated:\n\nnāhaṁ viriñco na kumāra-nāradauna brahma-putrā munayaḥ sureśāḥvidāma yasyehitam aṁśakāṁśakāna tat-svarūpaṁ pṛthag-īśa-māninaḥ\n\n“Neither I [Lord Śiva], nor Brahmā, nor the Aśvinī-kumāras, nor Nārada or the other great sages who are Brahmās sons, nor even the demigods can understand the pastimes and personality of the Supreme Lord.

It is not proper for a son to diminish the prestige of his father in any way, yet Bhṛgu displayed such discourtesy to test Brahmā’s quality of omniscience. This made Brahmā displeased, and he immediately wanted to burn Bhṛgu to ashes. From this it is proved that a close relative could not understand the glories of the devotee Bhṛgu. Therefore Brahmā was not accepted as the best among the guṇa-avatāras. Bhṛgu could understand that Brahmā was not the cause of all causes, he was only the creator of the universe. Later, when the sages pacified Brahmā, his anger subsided. Thereafter Bhṛgu went before Rudra, and Rudra, considering himself senior and Bhṛgu as junior, went to embrace Bhṛgu with affection. Bhṛgu, however, rebuked Rudra. When the junior Bhṛgu displayed such improper behavior to his senior three-eyed brother, Rudra became angry. When Rudra in his form as the annihilator was about to kill Bhṛgu, it took no time for Bhṛgu to understand the position of Rudra. Thereafter Bhṛgu went to the ocean of milk, where he found Lord Viṣṇu, whose lotus feet were served by Lakṣmī, and immediately kicked Lord Viṣṇu. The Lord immediately got up, and rather than becoming angry like Brahmā and Rudra, He joyfully offered respectful obeisances to Bhṛgu and prayed that Bhṛgu would excuse His offense. The Lord further said to Bhṛgu that He accepted the feet of a great devotee on His chest where His maidservant Lakṣmī resides. Pastimes displaying expertise on the path of attachment with intimacy or equality are depicted in various ways in a society of fools. But intelligent devotees display their affection for the Lord and the supreme expertise of devotees by manifesting their humility. That is why we can understand from verses composed by Śrī Mādhavendra Purīpāda, who is renowned for planting the seed of ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa, that as long as one is under the control of qualities like lust and anger, one continues to remain averse to the service of the Lord. Human beings can become free from the clutches of qualities like lust and anger only when they attain the service of Kṛṣṇa.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 9.329\n\nTEXT 329\n\ndekhiyā putrera anādara-vyavahārakrodhe brahmā hailena agni-avatāra\n\nSeeing the disrespectful behavior of his son, Brahmā became very angry and appeared like the incarnation of Agni.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 9.330\n\nTEXT 330\n\nbhasma karibena hena krodhe mana hailādekhiyā pitāra mūrti bhṛgu palāilā\n\nWhen Bhṛgu saw his father’s angry mood, he ran away in fear that he would be cursed and turned to ashes.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 9.331\n\nTEXT 331\n\nsabe bujhāilena brahmāra pāye dhari’“putrere ki gosāñi, e-mata krodha kari?”\n\nEveryone present there held the feet of Brahmā and pacified him, saying, “Please don’t be so cruel to your son.”\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 9.332\n\nTEXT 332\n\ntabe putra-snehe brahmā krodha pāsarilājala pāi’ yena agni susāmya hailā\n\nOut of affection for his son, Brahmā then controlled his anger as fire is extinguished with water.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 9.333\n\nTEXT 333\n\ntabe bhṛgu brahmāre bujhiyā bhāla-matekailāse āilā maheśvara parīkṣite\n\nAfter testing Brahmā, Bhṛgu Muni went directly to Kailāsa to test Śiva.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 9.334\n\nTEXT 334\n\nbhṛgu dekhi’ maheśvara ānandita haiyāuṭhilā pārvatī-saṅge ādara kariyā\n\nWhen Śiva saw Bhṛgu Muni, he became happy.

As a result, Śrī Mahāprabhu jokingly told Advaita Ācārya that He was defeated, because in the course of circumambulation one is unable to see the Lord’s face while walking behind the Lord. When Śrī Mahāprabhu took darśana of Lord Jagannātha, however, His eyes would not wander from Lord Jagannātha’s face for even a moment, in fact He would see the moonlike face of Lord Jagannātha everywhere. Advaita Ācārya gladly accepted defeat from Mahāprabhu and said that only Śrī Mahāprabhu knew the confidential meaning of such a statement.\n\nOne day Gadādhara Paṇḍita, the disciple of Puṇḍarīka, informed Mahāprabhu that he had forgotten his initiation mantra and desired to hear it from the Lord. But Mahāprabhu replied to Gadādhara Paṇḍita that he should wait till Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi came to Nīlācala. Mahāprabhu began to hear Śrīmad Bhāgavatam from Gadādhara Paṇḍita, and in this way He heard the characteristics of Prahlāda and Dhruva hundreds of times. While hearing Gadādhara’s recitation of Śrīmad Bhāgavatam and Svarūpa Dāmodara’s kīrtana, Mahāprabhu simultaneously manifested the eight transformations of ecstatic love. Among the sannyāsīs, Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara and Śrī Paramānanda Purī were the Lord’s principal associates and constant companions. One day, when Mahāprabhu was overwhelmed in ecstatic love of God, He fell into a well, and the devotees headed by Advaita Ācārya pulled the Lord out.\n\nWhen Puṇḍarīka arrived at Nīlācala, Mahāprabhu cried with love and Gadādhara took mantra initiation again from Vidyānidhi. During the Oḍana-ṣaṣṭhī festival the servants of Lord Jagannātha would dress Lord Jagannātha and Balarāma with starched cloth. When Puṇḍarīka criticized this behavior of Jagannātha’s servants, Svarūpa Dāmodara explained that the characteristics of the Supreme Lord are beyond the jurisdiction of worldly etiquette. But since this did not satisfy Vidyānidhi, Jagannātha and Balarāma enacting the pastime of slapping Vidyānidhi on his cheeks in a dream in order to destroy the karma jaḍa-smārtas’ sinful mentality of criticizing the behavior of the Supreme Lord’s servants. The Lord distributes mercy in dreams only to His select and dear associates. When Vidyānidhi told Svarūpa Dāmodara about the dream, they both happily joked with each other. Mahāprabhu used to address Vidyānidhi as bāpa, or father. Vidyānidhi’s devotion for the Ganges was genuine and incomparable.\n\nCB Antya-khaṇḍa 10.001\n\nTEXT 1\n\njaya jaya gauracandra śrīvatsa-lāñchanajaya śacī-garbha-ratna dharma-sanātana\n\nAll glories to Śrī Gauracandra, who bears the mark of Śrīvatsa!

Since activities like worship and meditation are unable to fully manifest the Supreme Lord, the process of saṅkīrtana is supreme. This saṅkīrtana is the best of all activities for reviving one’s relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is why in His Gaura pastimes Śrī Kṛṣṇacandra is addressed as saṅkīrtana-priya, or He who is fond of saṅkīrtana. He is the supreme worshipable Lord of all devotees. Those who have no love for Him are certainly nondevotees.

He ordered Mukunda to perform <em>kīrtana,</em> and He personally began to display wonderful symptoms of ecstatic love as He started dancing. In the course of dancing, Śrīman Mahāprabhu mercifully embraced Keśava Bhāratī, and Bhāratī immediately manifested symptoms of loving devotional service in his body. When early the next morning Śrī Gaurahari asked Śrī Keśava Bhāratī for permission to leave, Bhāratī expressed his desire to accompany the Lord in His ecstatic performance of <em>saṅkīrtana</em> to search for Kṛṣṇa. Keeping His spiritual master in front of Him, Mahāprabhu proceeded towards the forest with a desire to manifest His pastime of searching for Kṛṣṇa. He also ordered Candraśekhara Ācārya to return to Navadvīpa and inform everyone about His departure for the forest to search for Kṛṣṇa. When Śrī Śacīdevī, Śrī Advaita, and the other devotees of Navadvīpa heard from Śrī Candraśekhara about the Lord's acceptance of <em>sannyāsa </em>and departure for the forest, they became extremely morose. They all thought that they would give up their bodies because of being unable to tolerate separation from the Lord. At that time a voice from the sky informed them that within a few days the Lord would return to enjoy pastimes with them like before. Meanwhile, Gaurasundara along with Nityānanda, Gadādhara, Mukunda, and Keśava Bhāratī began to walk towards the west, and the Lord freely distributed His mercy in the form of the mellows of devotional service to Kṛṣṇa to those who followed behind Him. As the Lord entered Rāḍha-deśa and saw the natural beauty of that place and the cows grazing in the fields, He immediately remembered the pastimes of His previous incarnation and began to loudly chant the name of Hari and dance in ecstasy. Mahāprabhu then expressed a desire to perform the pastime of solitary worship in the secluded place where Vakreśvara Śiva resides. One night just before dawn, as Gaurasundara was displaying His pastime of taking rest after accepting His meal with the devotees in the house of one pious <em>brāhmaṇa,</em> the Lord suddenly left the devotees behind and secretly went to a field outside the village and began to cry loudly in separation from Kṛṣṇa. The devotees followed the sound of the Lord's crying and thereby located Him. While Mahāprabhu danced in ecstatic love as He listened to Mukunda's <em>kīrtana</em> and proceeded towards the west, He suddenly changed direction and proceeded towards the east. The Lord thus began to walk towards the Ganges. On seeing that the provinces He passed through were devoid of devotional service and afflicted by a severe famine of <em>kṛṣṇa-kīrtana</em>, the Lord became so distressed that He resolved to give up His life. At that time the Lord suddenly heard the chanting of the name of Hari from the mouth of a fortunate cowherd boy and concluded that the chanting of the holy name of Hari was still current at that place because of the glories of the great devotee Gaṅgā, who emanated from Lord Viṣṇu's lotus feet. In the association of Nityānanda, Śrī Mahāprabhu displayed the pastime of taking bath and offering various prayers in glorification of the Ganges. That night the Lord and Nityānanda stayed at the house of one fortunate person. On the next day all the devotees came and joined the Lord. The Lord then departed with His devotees for Nīlācala.</p><p>Mahāprabhu sent Nityānanda to solace the devotee residents of Navadvīpa, and He instructed Nityānanda to inform everyone that He had decided to go see the Lord of Nīlācala and would wait for them at the house of Advaita. After instructing Nityānanda to bring all the devotees to Śāntipura, Mahāprabhu went to Phuliyā, the place of Ṭhākura Haridāsa. Meanwhile, Nityānanda went to the house of Jagannātha Miśra in Māyāpur and explained everything in detail and variously solaced Śrī Śacīdevī, who had been fasting for twelve days, who was afflicted with feelings of separation, and who was nondifferent from Mother Yaśodā. On hearing the news about Mahāprabhu, all the residents of Navadvīpa including children, old people, women, fit, and unfit people became overwhelmed with eagerness to see the Lord and immediately started for Phuliyā. Those atheistic people who previously committed offenses at the feet of Mahāprabhu began to repent as they remembered their past offenses. Soon the entire village of Phuliyā became filled with a vast crowd of people. Everyone became greatly satisfied by seeing Mahāprabhu. When Mahāprabhu left Phuliyā and came to the house of Advaita Ācārya in Śāntipura, Advaita Ācārya Prabhu lost conscious in ecstasy. Then Acyutānanda, the son of Advaita, came and fell at the feet of Gaurāṅga, and the Lord picked him up and placed him on His lap. The child Acyutānanda then spoke a wonderful, conclusive statement. Meanwhile, Śrīvāsa and other devotees from Nadia came with Nityānanda to meet the Lord at Śāntipura. In the Lord's grand festival of chanting and dancing at the house of Advaita, various newer and newer transformations of ecstatic love manifested. Climbing on the throne of Lord Viṣṇu, Mahāprabhu began to personally reveal His own glories. Then, after pacifying all the devotees, winding up His pastimes of opulence, and regaining His external consciousness, the Lord repeated His Vṛndāvana pastimes by engaging with the devotees in various pastimes like taking bath and eating meals.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 1.001</p><p><strong>TEXT 1</strong></p><p>avatīrṇau sa-kāruṇyau   paricchinnau sad-īśvarau<br />śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-nityānandau   dvau bhrātarau bhaje</p><p><strong>I worship the two brothers, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya and Śrī Nityānanda, who have descended in this world as the supreme controllers.

The Vedic scriptures, however, have established that You are the source of everything.” In this way, Śrī Acyutānanda established Śrī Caitanya as the object of the two Vedic statements: <em>dvā suparṇā </em>and <em>yato vā imāni </em>[The <em>Taittirīya Upaniṣad</em> (3.1.1) declares: <em>yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante</em>. “The Supreme Absolute Truth is that from which everything is born.].</p><p>In both the <em>Muṇḍaka</em> <em>Upaniṣad </em>(3.1.1) and in the <em>Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad</em> (4.6) it is stated:</p><p>dvā suparṇā sayujā sakhāyā<br />samānaṁ vṛkṣaṁ pariṣasvajāte</p><p>tayor anyaḥ pippalaṁ svādv atty<br />anaśnann anyo 'bhicākaśīti</p><p>“Two companion birds sit together in the shelter of the same <em>pippala</em> tree.

One of them is part and parcel of the Supreme Brahman and is subordinate to Him. He enjoys the fruits, while the other bird simply witnesses.” In the <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> (11.11.6) it is stated:</p><p>suparṇāv etau sadṛśau sakhāyau<br />yadṛcchayaitau kṛta-nīḍau ca vṛkṣe</p><p>ekas tayoḥ khādati pippalānnam<br />anyo niranno 'pi balena bhūyān</p><p>“By chance, two birds have made a nest together in the same tree.

Yet before the strong will of the independent Lord, the devotees headed by Śrī Advaita relented. Just before the commencement of His journey the Lord solaced His devotees, who were afflicted by thoughts of separation, by instructing them to worship Kṛṣṇa. Gaurasundara's devotees felt pangs of separation similar to the pangs of separation felt by the residents of Vraja when Kṛṣṇa left for Mathurā, for they were nondifferent from the residents of Vraja and Gaurasundara was nondifferent from the son of Nanda. Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, Gadādhara, Mukunda, Govinda, Jagadānanda, and Brahmānanda accompanied the Lord. On the way, the Lord asked the devotees if they had any accumulated possessions with them and thereby tested their qualities of indifference and freedom from desires for material opulences. He was very pleased on learning that none of them had brought any accumulated wealth. While instructing the devotees to fully depend on Kṛṣṇa, the Lord arrived at the house of Ananta Paṇḍita in the village of Āṭisārā and exhibited the pastime of accepting his hospitality. Eventually the Lord came to the holy place named Chatrabhoga and saw the Ambuliṅga-ghāṭa there. In this connection the author has described the story of Ambu-liṅga Śiva. After taking <em>darśana</em> and bath at Śatamukhī-gaṅgā, the Lord became absorbed in His own internal mood. Suddenly, Rāmacandra Khān, the administrator of Chatrabhoga village, came there and offered obeisances to the Lord. He was very astonished to see the Lord's intense eagerness to see Lord Jagannātha. On understanding the identity of Rāmacandra Khān, the Lord mercifully ordered him to arrange passage for Him to go to Nīlācala. Rāmacandra Khān requested the Lord and His devotees to first accept a meal at his house, and Mahāprabhu mercifully accepted his invitation. The people of Chatrabhoga thus received an opportunity to witness the transcendental ecstatic madness of the Lord. After three quarters of the night passed and Mahāprabhu regained His external consciousness, Rāmacandra Khān arranged a boat for Mahāprabhu's journey. On the boat, Gaurasundara began to display wonderful symptoms of ecstatic love. Then, on the Lord's order, Mukunda began to sing on the boat, and because of the Lord's dancing the boat came on the verge of capsizing. When the boatman forbade them from performing <em>kīrtana</em> by informing them about the danger of pirates and wild aquatics like crocodiles, Mahāprabhu assured the devotees about their safety by narrating to them topics of the infallible Sudarśana <em>cakra,</em> which protects the devotees.</p><p>After entering Orissa, Mahāprabhu took bath at a place known as Gaṅgā-ghāṭa and displayed the pastime of offering obeisances to Śiva, the King of Vaiṣṇavas, installed there by Yudhiṣṭhira. Leaving the devotees in a temple, the Lord went alone to the householders' houses and displayed the pastime of begging alms by spreading the end of His cloth. Jagadānanda Paṇḍita cooked whatever foodstuffs the Lord collected by begging. After taking His meal with the devotees, the Lord spent that night performing <em>saṅkīrtana</em> in that village. Early the next morning the Lord again started towards Purī. On the way, a road tax collector obstructed the Lord's path and demanded tax from Him. When he subsequently observed the Lord's uncommon effulgence, he allowed the Lord to pass but asked the devotees to pay tax. Later, on seeing Mahāprabhu's pastime of simultaneous indifference and affection for the devotees, the tax collector became struck with wonder and fell at the Lord's feet, begging forgiveness. After forgiving the tax collector, the Lord gradually came to the Suvarṇarekhā River and therein took bath with the devotees. As Mahāprabhu proceeded on, the devotees headed by Avadhūta Nityānanda and Jagadānanda fell far behind the Lord. During the journey Jagadānanda had been carrying the Lord's <em>sannyāsa</em> <em>daṇḍa</em>. When Jagadānanda left that <em>daṇḍa</em> with Nityānanda and went out to beg alms, Nityānanda took the <em>daṇḍa</em> in His hand and began to think that it could never be fair that the same Lord whom He carries in His heart would carry a <em>daṇḍa</em>. Thinking in this way Śrī Nityānanda broke the Lord's <em>daṇḍa</em> into three pieces. This <em>daṇḍa</em>-breaking pastime of Nityānanda is incomprehensible to the minds of ordinary people; only Śrī Nityānanda knows the confidential purport of this pastime. Later on, when Paṇḍita Jagadānanda approached the Lord with the pieces of the broken <em>daṇḍa</em>, Gaurasundara displayed the pastime of becoming externally angry with Nityānanda. He then left the devotees' company and proceeded alone to the place of Jaleśvara Śiva. Śrī Gaurasundara, who is the supreme teacher of all, then manifested His pastime of ecstatic chanting and dancing before Śiva, who is the topmost Vaiṣṇava. Meanwhile, Śrī Nityānanda and the devotees who had been left behind arrived there, and the Lord embraced them with ecstasy, discussed with them various topics, and then narrated the glories of Nityānanda.</p><p>After spending that night in Jaleśvara, the next morning on the way to Bāṅsadaha Mahāprabhu enacted the pastime of conversing with a <em>tāntrika-sannyāsī</em>. He then came to the village of Remuṇā, where He chanted and danced before Gopīnātha in the association of the devotees. Thereafter the Lord came to Yājapura, and after displaying the pastime of taking bath with the devotees in the river Vaitaraṇī, the Lord suddenly left everyone behind and went somewhere and then again came before their sight. In this way the Lord gradually came to Cuttack, and after taking <em>darśana</em> of Sākṣi-gopāla, He went to Bhuvaneśvara. In this regard the author elaborately describes the topics of Bhuvaneśvara Śiva mentioned in the <em>Skanda Purāṇa</em>. He also describes the glories of the place called Ekāmraka, the meaning behind the name Bhuvaneśvara, the glories of Purī, and the topics of Śiva's position as the protector of the Lord's abodes. When Mahāprabhu arrived there, He danced jubilantly before Bhuvaneśvara Śiva. From there, the Lord went to Kamalapura. On seeing the flag on top of the Jagannātha temple, the Lord became overwhelmed with ecstasy. When Mahāprabhu came to Āṭhāranālā He expressed a desire to go see Lord Jagannātha alone. With intense eagerness He then went ahead alone and entered the temple of Jagannātha. On seeing Jagannātha and meeting the Lord after a long separation, Mahāprabhu became so absorbed in ecstasy that as He was about to embrace Jagannātha He fell unconscious to the ground. At that time Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was in the temple taking <em>darśana</em> of Lord Jagannātha. On seeing the condition of the new <em>sannyāsī</em>, he understood according to the symptoms described in the scriptures that the Lord was an exalted personality. When the temple guards were about to beat the Lord, Sārvabhauma forbade them from doing so and brought Mahāprabhu to his own house. By and by, the devotees headed by Nityānanda arrived there. After the Lord regained His external consciousness, He resolved to see Lord Jagannātha only from behind the Garuḍa pillar. Then, after taking bath, the Lord displayed the pastime of honoring <em>mahā-prasāda</em> with the devotees at the house of Sārvabhauma.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.001</p><p><strong>TEXT 1</strong></p><p>jaya jaya gauracandra jaya sarva-prāṇa<br />jaya duṣṭa-bhayaṅkara jaya śiṣṭa-trāṇa</p><p><strong>All glories to Gauracandra!

After accepting the renounced order of life, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanyadeva did not accept that the living entities are one with Brahman or that this material world is false. The Māyāvādīs, who do not discriminate between sinful and sober persons, and the fruitive workers, who do discriminate, are both enthusiastic for material activities born of the three modes of nature, but since Śrī Gaurasundara did not approve of such conceptions of the materialists, <em>karmīs</em>, <em>jñānīs</em>, and <em>yogīs</em>, He exhibited the pastime of preaching pure devotional service and distributing ecstatic love of Kṛṣṇa.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.002</p><p><strong>TEXT 2</strong></p><p>jaya śeṣa ramā aja bhavera īśvara<br />jaya kṛpā-sindhu dīnabandhu nyāsi-vara</p><p><strong>All glories to the Lord of Ananta Śeṣa, Lakṣmī, Brahmā, and Śiva!

So that no one would consider that Mahāprabhu was not the preacher of a <em>mahā-bhāgavata's</em> pastimes by considering Him an ordinary <em>karmī</em>- or <em>jñānī</em>-<em>sannyāsī</em>, who are both forced to enjoy the fruits of their karma, Mahāprabhu was the only friend of the <em>karmīs</em>, <em>jñānīs</em>, materialists, and fallen souls; He was the friend of the devotees; He was most merciful; He was the Lord of all; and He was <em>svayam-rūpa</em> Kṛṣṇa. Since He enacted the pastime of giving up all the misconceptions of the materialists, <em>karmīs</em>, <em>jñānīs</em>, and pseudo devotees, He is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. To reveal that all manifestations are exhibitions of His <em>acintya-bhedābheda</em>, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, accepted the dress of the best of the <em>mahā-bhāgavata</em> <em>sannyāsīs</em>. Rather than attributing the spirit of worldly enjoyment on the Supreme Lord and accepting the human beings as God, the Supreme Lord remained aloof from the conceptions of material time, place, and circumstance in the course of adventing in this world, in India, in Bengal, in Nadia to teach the conclusion of <em>acintya-bhedābheda</em> philosophy and to enact the pastime of awarding living entities the ultimate goal of life.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.003</p><p><strong>TEXT 3</strong></p><p>bhakta-goṣṭhi-sahita gaurāṅga jaya jaya<br />kṛpā kara prabhu, yena toṅhe mana raya</p><p><strong>All glories to Gaurāṅga along with His devotees!

By thinking that Hari, Guru, and Vaiṣṇava are mortal, they cannot achieve realization of their <em>sac-cid-ānanda </em>status because of madness for sense gratification. As a result, they end up either knowingly or unknowingly becoming envious of Hari and Guru. Some of them dedicate themselves to <em>karma-kāṇḍa</em>, and because of desiring material enjoyment some consider sense gratification and liberation their ultimate goal of life. But they cannot understand that by the will of Śrī Kṛṣṇacandra, the Guru and Vaiṣṇavas are able to destroy their narrow-mindedness. The Guru and Vaiṣṇavas are full of Kṛṣṇa's potencies. There is no difference between the energy and the energetic. Yet the energy can never be identified as the energetic. This is the difference between the philosophies of the impersonalists and the devotees of the Lord. Philosophies like <em>viśiṣṭādvaita </em>(specific monism), <em>śuddha-dvaita </em>(purified dualism), and <em>śuddhādvaita </em>(purified monism) have manifested from portions of the philosophy of <em>acintya-bhedābheda</em> (inconceivable oneness and difference). Topics of the complete understanding have, in the course of narrating Śrī Caitanya's pastimes, been clearly revealed to service-inclined persons by Śrīla Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, the most respectable staunch follower of Śrī Rūpa, in the verse <em>vande gurūn īśa </em>[<em>vande gurūn īśa-bhaktān   īśam īśāvatārakān, tat-prakāśāṁś ca tac-chaktīḥ   kṛṣṇa-caitanya-saṁjñakam, </em>“I offer my respectful obeisances unto the spiritual masters, the devotees of the Lord, the Lord's incarnations, His plenary portions, His energies and the primeval Lord Himself, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya.] and in his descriptions of the Pañca-tattva. People who are offenders at the feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇadāsa and who do not understand the purport of <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> are either gross materialists or Māyāvādīs. The Māyāvādīs cannot understand the eternal position of the Lord's variegated energies because of their conception of oneness. In the course of their worship of many gods, the <em>karmīs</em> fall into hellish conditions by ascribing differences between Kṛṣṇa and Guru-Vaiṣṇavas.</p><p>In the <em>Nārada-pañcarātra </em>(1.14.4) Śrī Mahādeva says:</p><p>rakṣitā yasya bhagavān   kalyāṇaṁ tasya santatam<br />sa yasya vighna-kartā ca   rakṣituṁ taṁ ca kaḥ kṣamaḥ</p><p>“A person who is protected by the Supreme Lord becomes victorious everywhere, and one who is rejected by the Supreme Lord can never be protected by anyone.”</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.034</p><p><strong>TEXT 34</strong></p><p>hena-mate śrī-gaurasundara nīlācale<br />āisena caliyā āpana-kutūhale</p><p><strong>In this way Śrī Gaurasundara departed for Nīlācala in His own joyful mood.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.035</p><p><strong>TEXT 35</strong></p><p>nityānanda, gadādhara, mukunda, govinda<br />saṁhati jagadānanda, āra brahmānanda</p><p><strong>The Lord was accompanied by Nityānanda, Gadādhara, Mukunda, Govinda, Jagadānanda, and Brahmānanda.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.036</p><p><strong>TEXT 36</strong></p><p>pathe prabhu parīkṣā karena sabā'-prati<br />“ki sambala āche bala kāhāra saṁhati</p><p><strong>On the way the Lord tested everyone by asking, “What assets do you have with you?</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.037</p><p><strong>TEXT 37</strong></p><p>ke vā ki diyāche kāre pathera sambala<br />niṣkapaṭe mora sthāne kaha ta' sakala”</p><p><strong>“All of you tell Me frankly whether anyone has given anything to you for the journey.”</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.038</p><p><strong>TEXT 38</strong></p><p>sabe bale,—“prabhu, vinā ājñāya tomāra<br />kāra dravya laite vāśakti āche kāra”</p><p><strong>They replied, “O Lord, who has the power to bring anything without Your permission?”</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.039</p><p><strong>TEXT 39</strong></p><p>śuniyā ṭhākura baḍa santoṣa hailā<br />śeṣe sei lakṣye tattva kahite lāgilā</p><p><strong>On hearing their reply, the Lord was greatly satisfied.

Since pseudo devotees who deviate from the path of devotional service imagine a distinction between Guru-Vaiṣṇava and the Supreme Lord, they cannot understand the concept of oneness. The philosophy of <em>acintya-bhedābheda</em> is the only cause for the nourishment of transcendental mellows. The distinction or variegatedness found in spiritual <em>rasa</em> is eternal and is not opposed to the Vedic statement: <em>ekam evādvitīyam</em>—“The Absolute Truth is one without a second.” Those who claim “according to the statement <em>ekam evādvitīyam</em> there are no differences born of variegatedness or distinctions in the Absolute Truth” are Māyāvādīs. As soon as the distinction between <em>viṣaya </em>(the object of worship) and <em>āśraya</em> (the worshiper) is denied, the philosophy of impersonalism becomes manifest. Because of a lack of knowledge regarding the distinctions between <em>viṣaya </em>and <em>āśraya</em>, unauthorized conclusions and degradation into material enjoyment are achieved, as prominently found among the Buddhists and <em>sahajiyās</em>.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.041</p><p><strong>TEXT 41</strong></p><p>bhoktavya adṛṣṭe thāke ye-dine likhana<br />araṇye o āsi' mile avaśya takhana</p><p><strong>“If you are destined to receive some eatables, you will certainly obtain them, even if you are in the forest.</strong></p><p>In the <em>Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa </em>(7.74) it is stated:</p><p>aprarthitani duḥkhāni<br />tathaiva ayaṁ hi dehināṁ<br />sukhāni api tathā manye<br />daivam atrātiricyate</p><p>“Distress comes to embodied souls without asking, similarly happiness will also come by the arrangement of providence.”</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.042</p><p><strong>TEXT 42</strong></p><p>prabhu yāre ye-divasa nā likhe āhāra<br />rāja-putra hau tabu upavāsa tāra</p><p><strong>“If the Supreme Lord does not set aside food for a person, he will not eat, even if he is the son of a king.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.043</p><p><strong>TEXT 43</strong></p><p>thākile o khāite nā pāre ājñā-vine<br />akasmāt kalaha karaye kāro sane</p><p><strong>“Without the Lord's sanction one may not be able to eat even if there is food, for he may suddenly quarrel with someone.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.044</p><p><strong>TEXT 44</strong></p><p>krodha kari' bale,—“muñi nā khāimu bhāta'<br />divya kari' rahe nija śire diye hāta</p><p><strong>“In an angry mood, he may say, `I will not eat today.'

There is a huge temple of Tripurāsundarī Mahāmāyā there. The Ambuliṅga-ghāṭa is about one and a half miles from the temple of Tripurāsundarī. The present name of Ambuliṅga-ghāṭa is Baḍāsī-grāma. It is situated in the 43rd subdivision within the police jurisdiction of Mathurāpura. When Mahāprabhu visited this place, the Ganges flowed in a hundred streams on the eastern side of Baḍāsī-grāma. Although at present the hundred streams of the Ganges are not seen, there are still some signs like deep ravines there. The temple of Ambu-liṅga is still found there. When we inquired from the local people, we learned that the temple and its properties were managed by Mahānta Śrīyukta Satish Giri of Tārakeśvara, but as a result of litigation they have been transferred to one Śrīyukta Varadā Prasāda Rāya Chaudhurī, a landlord of Kāśī-nagara.</p><p>Within the temple is situated Ambu-liṅga Śiva. There is one piece of stone in the temple that resembles a Gaurī-paṭṭa [the base that supports a Śiva-liṅga]. In the middle of that stone there is a hole filled with water. The Ambu-liṅga is situated within that water. On the forehead of that <em>liṅga</em> there is a silver half-moon. Above this <em>liṅga</em> there are Deities of Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa and Gopāla. The site known as Cakra-tīrtha is situated nearly one mile southeast of Ambu-liṅga. Local people say that the Ganges flowed through that place long ago. At present one can see a pond as the remnant of the Ganges. There is a Deity of Viṣṇu there known as Mādhava. During the local festival, people first take bath in that pond and then worship the Lord at Cakra-tīrtha. In the month of May, 1930, we, along with many other Vaiṣṇavas, visited Chatrabhoga to select a place to establish the footprints of Śrī Śrī Caitanya. For an elaborate description of this, one should read <em>Gauḍīya</em> magazine, 8th year, number 42.</p><p>Now a temple of Śrī Gaura's lotus feet has been established at this place by the joint endeavor of the President and devotees of Śrī Caitanya Maṭha, Māyāpur, the birthplace of Śrī Gaura.</p><p>The site of Ambu-liṅga is currently owned by Śrīyukta Varadākānta Prasāda Rāya Chaudhurī. One can still see moss-covered Ganges water at this place.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.063</p><p><strong>TEXT 63</strong></p><p>ambu-liṅga-śaṅkara hailā ye nimitta<br />sei kathā kahi śuna hañā eka citta</p><p><strong>Hear attentively the following narration of how Ambu-liṅga Śiva appeared there.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.064</p><p><strong>TEXT 64</strong></p><p>pūrve bhagīratha kari' gaṅgā-ārādhana<br />gaṅgā ānilena vaṁśa-uddhāra-kāraṇa</p><p><strong>Previously Bhagiratha worshiped the Ganges and brought her to this world to deliver his forefathers.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.065</p><p><strong>TEXT 65</strong></p><p>gaṅgāra virahe śiva vihvala haiyā<br />śiva āilena śeṣe gaṅgā saṅariyā</p><p><strong>Śiva became overwhelmed in separation from the Ganges.

Such blatant indirect approval of foolish behavior was simply to deceive those so-called <em>brāhmaṇas</em> who are attached to <em>karma-kāṇḍa</em>, who are worthy of being deceived, and who are perpetually bereft of spiritual understanding. Realizing that such indirect approval would in the future benefit people attached to <em>karma-kāṇḍa</em>, the Lord attempted to please those <em>karmīs</em> who are opposed to spiritual values. That way in the future they may also become Vaiṣṇavas and achieve auspiciousness by becoming dear to the Lord. Mahāprabhu never displayed any pastime of accepting anything other than <em>kṛṣṇa-prasāda</em>. He personally displayed the pastime of chanting one hundred thousand names of Kṛṣṇa, and He would first offer any food cooked by a so-called <em>brāhmaṇa</em> to Kṛṣṇa and then honor it. The Lord enacted this pastime of accepting the non-Vaiṣṇava behavior of <em>smārtas</em> to protect the community of so-called <em>brāhmaṇas</em> who would perpetually fall into hell by considering Him as one who disrespects so-called <em>brāhmaṇas</em>. Actually Mahāprabhu demonstrated the spiritual principle that Lord Kṛṣṇa never accepts anything offered by a person who does not chant one hundred thousand names. Exalted devotees daily chant one hundred thousand names and do not accept anything other than the remnants of Hari, Guru, and Vaiṣṇava. Therefore the remnants of <em>mahā-prasāda</em> that has been relished by devotees are certainly spiritual foodstuffs. Foods that have not been offered to the Lord are to be rejected as stool and urine.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.109</p><p><strong>TEXT 109</strong></p><p>viśeṣe calila ye avadhi jagannāthe<br />nāme se bhojana prabhu kare sei haite</p><p><strong>In particular, on His journey to Jagannātha Purī, the Lord ate only out of formality.</strong></p><p><em>Brāhmaṇas</em> engaged in the pure service of Viṣṇu are dear to the Supreme Lord.

As a result of the impersonal conceptions found in <em>pañcopāsanā</em> (the process of worshiping the five deities Viṣṇu, Śiva, Durgā, Gaṇeśa, and Sūrya), the acceptance of human beings as God has gradually developed in Kali-yuga. But <em>svayam-rūpa</em> Kṛṣṇacandra manifested His own Śrī Caitanya pastimes to distribute love for Kṛṣṇa to all living entities. The attempt to accept as God human beings who imitate Śrī Caitanya is an act of foolishness. <em>Svayam-rūpa</em> Kṛṣṇacandra does not give those whose hearts are polluted the power to realize His Gaura pastimes, which are meant for instructing all. Without the mercy of Śrī Nityānanda no one has the qualification to serve Śrī Gaurasundara, to understand Him, or to attain love of Kṛṣṇa.</p><p>In the <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> (10.60.38) it is stated:</p><p>tvaṁ vai samasta-puruṣārtha-mayaḥ phalātmā<br />yad-vāñchayā su-matayo visṛjanti kṛtsnam<br />teṣāṁ vibho samucito bhavataḥ samājaḥ<br />puṁsaḥ striyāś ca ratayoḥ sukha-duḥkhinor na</p><p>“You are the embodiment of all human goals and are Yourself the final aim of life.

By personally begging from door to door and having His devotees beg from door to door, Śrī Gaurasundara displayed the pastime of maintaining His followers, or serving the Vaiṣṇavas. Although when envious people see many persons give donations to the Gauḍīya Maṭha devotees who collect alms, they create problems for those devotees, the devotees do not hesitate to boldly preach, “Only the Gauḍīya Maṭha can constantly protect the religious principles for attaining love of God that were preached by Śrī Gaurasundara.” [By the nature of the disciplic succession, this ability is passed down to those who are qualified.] One atheistic offender has openly admitted, “The Śrī Gauḍīya Maṭha process of preaching in various countries is the path inaugurated by Śrī Gaurasundara. Actually, Śrī Gauḍīya Maṭha has become successful in the activities of properly preaching the teachings of Śrī Gaurasundara.” Even the atheistic, blasphemous <em>sahajiyās</em> cannot deny this fact. Although the servants of Gauḍīya Maṭha do not approve of the artificial Vaiṣṇava behavior of <em>prākṛta-sahajiyās</em>, and although the <em>sahajiyās</em> always try to oppose such servants, the <em>sahajiyās</em> openly admit that the preachers of Gauḍīya Maṭha follow in the footsteps of Mahāprabhu by desiring the benefit of all living entities. Just as Śrī Gaurasundara acted as the maintainer of the devotees by nourishing their spiritual lives and removing their obstacles, His servants also do the same for His service.

But sometimes Jagadānanda Prabhu would carry Mahāprabhu's <em>daṇḍa</em> while going out to beg alms. Accepting the responsibility of carefully protecting Mahāprabhu's <em>daṇḍa</em>, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu took the <em>daṇḍa</em> from Jagadānanda and said to the <em>daṇḍa</em>, “We always carry Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Lord of the fourteen worlds, within our hearts. We are His eternal servants. You are committing an offense by making that Lord your carrier. Therefore it is most appropriate for us to carry whatever symbols of accepting rules or renouncing restricted things that Śrī Kṛṣṇa in the form of a devotee has taken in His hand and on His shoulder. O <em>daṇḍa</em>, do not try to become the lord of My Lord. Do not engage Mahāprabhu in carrying you any more.” The <em>prākṛta-sahajiyā,</em> so-called devotees engage Kṛṣṇa in supplying their sense gratification by demanding religiosity, economic development, sense gratification, and liberation from Him. This is not the mentality of devotees.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.208</p><p><strong>TEXT 208</strong></p><p>eta bali' balarāma parama pracaṇḍa<br />phelilena daṇḍa bhāṅgi' kari' tina khaṇḍa</p><p><strong>After speaking in this way, the most powerful Balarāma broke the <em>daṇḍa</em> into three pieces.</strong></p><p>The <em>ekadaṇḍī</em> so-called <em>paramahaṁsas</em> who follow the philosophy of impersonalism always neglect the <em>tridaṇḍīs</em>. Since Śrī Gaurasundara exhibited the pastime of pretending to accept <em>ekadaṇḍa</em> <em>sannyāsa</em>, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu broke that <em>daṇḍa</em> into three pieces and turned it into a <em>tridaṇḍa</em>. He then entrusted the service of carrying that <em>daṇḍa</em> to the servants of the Lord. That is why Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī Prabhu has quoted in his <em>Upadeśāmṛta </em>the verse from the <em>Haṁsa-gīti </em>section of the ancient literature <em>Mahābhārata</em>, beginning <em>vāco vegaṁ </em>[<em>vāco vegaṁ manasaḥ krodha-vegaṁjihvā-vegam udaropastha-vegam, etān vegān yo viṣaheta dhīraḥsarvām apīmāṁ pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt, </em>“A sober person who can tolerate the urge to speak, the mind's demands, the actions of anger and the urges of the tongue, belly and genitals is qualified to make disciples all over the world.], which provides confirmation and qualification for accepting <em>tridaṇḍa</em> <em>sannyāsa</em> and which declares that every <em>tridaṇḍa</em> <em>sannyāsī</em> is expected to follow in the footsteps of Śrī Rūpa. Apyaya Dīkṣita has presented the covered-Buddhist Māyāvādīs' strong protest against the acceptance of <em>tridaṇḍa</em> <em>sannyāsa</em> in his commentary known as <em>Parimala</em>. Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu transformed Śrī Gaurasundara's <em>ekadaṇḍa</em> into <em>tridaṇḍa</em> to display the irrelevance of the Māyāvādī Apyaya Dīkṣita's future writing against devotional service in his books <em>Nyāya-rakṣā-maṇi </em>and <em>Śivārka-maṇi-dīpikā</em>. Śrī Baladeva Prabhu transformed the <em>ekadaṇḍa</em> of the <em>sannyāsī</em>-dressed Śrī Caitanyadeva into a <em>tridaṇḍa</em> to reveal that the impersonalists' acceptance of <em>ekadaṇḍa</em>, which is the symbol of Māyāvāda, and the current and former practices of accepting <em>sannyāsa</em> in the <em>śuddha-dvaita </em>(purified dualism) disciplic succession are not approved by the Madhva-Gauḍīya-sampradāya. This is fully approved by the <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em>, and it is the conviction of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas. Without becoming a <em>tridaṇḍī</em>, no one can control himself. In the principle of <em>tridaṇḍa</em> found in <em>karma-kāṇḍa</em>, the <em>indra-daṇḍa</em>, <em>vajra-daṇḍa</em>, and <em>brahma-daṇḍa </em>are combined with the <em>jīva-daṇḍa</em>. In his explanation on <em>tridaṇḍa</em>, Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī Prabhu has revealed to the transcendental <em>tridaṇḍīs</em> the topics of controlling one's body, mind, and speech. When <em>tridaṇḍa</em> is combined with <em>jīva-daṇḍa</em>, then according to the external conception of <em>tridaṇḍa</em>, <em>ekadaṇḍa</em> becomes the principle of <em>paramahaṁsa-dharma</em>. But since in the principle of <em>ekadaṇḍa</em>, the transcendental state beyond the three modes of nature attributes faults in the process described in the <em>Pañcarātras</em>, <em>ekadaṇḍa</em> in the form of <em>tridaṇḍa</em> has been accepted in the process described in the <em>Pañcarātras</em>. This system is directly and indirectly followed in the Brahma-sampradāya, in the Brahma-Madhva-sampradāya, and in the Brahma-Madhva-Gauḍīya-sampradāya.</p><p>Therefore the teachings of Śrī Gaura-Nityānanda cannot be different from those of the Śrī Brahma-Madhva-Gauḍīya-sampradāya. From this time on, persons under the shelter of Śrī Caitanyadeva have become known as Gauḍīya <em>tridaṇḍi-svāmīs</em>. Śrī Prabodhānanda Sarasvatīpada's acceptance of <em>sannyāsa</em> on the path of regulative principles and the Śrī Rūpānuga's acceptance of <em>sannyāsa</em> on the path of <em>paramahaṁsa</em> did not create any mutual contradiction. Although the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas accept <em>sannyāsa</em> on the path of regulative principles, they are not opposed to the <em>paramahaṁsa-dharma </em>of the followers of Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Sanātana. Although in <em>paramahaṁsa-dharma</em> the symbols found in the regulative path are considered external, acceptance of external symptoms does not violate the principles of the <em>paramahaṁsas</em>. Although the five other Vrajavāsī Gosvāmīs followed the footsteps of Śrī Sanātana in accepting the dress of <em>paramahaṁsas</em>, Śrī Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī Gosvāmī accepted <em>tridaṇḍa</em> <em>sannyāsa</em> on the path of regulative principles and recorded the Gauḍīya doctrine in his book <em>Śrī Caitanya-candrāmṛta</em>. The recent pure devotional endeavors by the followers of Śrī Rūpa to rectify the behavior of the fallen, deviant, so-called <em>paramahaṁsas</em>, to protect the proper code of conduct, and to inaugurate the path of regulative principles for the purpose of counteracting the attack on those who traverse the path of <em>anurāga</em>, or loving attachment, have become the object of ignorant people's opposition and neglect. Because of transgressing the etiquette of respecting the Lord's manifestations, there have been many obstacles in the worship of the Absolute Truth in every<em> yuga</em>. Those who do not understand the purport of the path of regulative principles consider the inauspiciousness resulting from transgressing that path as progress on that path. Moreover, by respecting only the path of regulative principles, the more elevated path becomes closed. Śrīla Prabodhānanda Tridaṇḍipāda was not opposed to the Six Gosvāmīs of Vṛndāvana. But the shortsighted, so-called followers of the Gosvāmīs accepted the conception of Śrī Prabodhānanda as conflicting. As a result, the followers of such people ended up spreading communal dispute.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.209</p><p><strong>TEXT 209</strong></p><p>īśvarera icchā-mātra īśvara se jāne<br />kena bhāṅgilena daṇḍa, jāniba kemane</p><p><strong>Only the Supreme Lord knows the will of the Supreme Lord.

Śrī Nityānanda assists in Śrī Gaurasundara's preaching of ecstatic love of God in ten different forms. Only Śrī Nityānanda is able to reveal to the world the mystery of Śrī Caitanya's acceptance of <em>ekadaṇḍa</em> and, in the position of being without <em>daṇḍa</em>, His acceptance of <em>tridaṇḍa</em>. The <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> has prescribed for the devotees of Viṣṇu the process of accepting <em>tridaṇḍa</em>. Only the <em>tridaṇḍīs</em> are able to actually attain the stage of <em>paramahaṁsa</em>, whereas <em>ekadaṇḍīs</em> preaching the mundane concept of impersonalism cannot understand their own position. Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu alone is able to reveal many of the favorable items of spiritual consideration, like the characteristics and differences found in the <em>ekadaṇḍa</em>, which is a combination of <em>jīva-daṇḍa</em> with the <em>tridaṇḍa</em> of the Vedic <em>sanātana-dharma, </em>and how oneness can be the combination of many.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.213</p><p><strong>TEXT 213</strong></p><p>balarāma vinā anya caitanyera daṇḍa<br />bhāṅgibāre pāre hena ke āche pracaṇḍa?</p><p><strong>Who other than Balarāma is powerful enough to break Lord Caitanya's <em>daṇḍa</em>?</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.214</p><p><strong>TEXT 214</strong></p><p>sakala bujhāya chale śrī-gaurasundare<br />ye jānaye marma, sei jana sukhe tare</p><p><strong>Śrī Gaurasundara taught everyone by this pretext.

If You cannot forgive Me, then punish Me appropriately.”</strong></p><p>The <em>daṇḍa</em> is carried by a <em>sannyāsī</em> who has not yet attained the platform of <em>paramahaṁsa</em>. Therefore everyone can understand that a <em>sannyāsī</em> without a <em>daṇḍa</em> has attained the final stage of spiritual life. Worldly opulences cannot disturb such a person. But since <em>paramahaṁsas</em> do not accept this symbol of renunciation, ordinary people cannot understand their exalted position. That is why foolish people consider the topmost <em>paramahaṁsa</em> Vaiṣṇavas to be inferior to themselves. Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu broke the bamboo <em>daṇḍa</em> of <em>svayam-rūpa</em> Vrajendra-nandana, Śrī Caitanya, so that people would not mistakenly consider anyone who simply carries a <em>daṇḍa</em> made of bamboo to be situated just below the topmost <em>paramahaṁsa</em> platform. Realizing that people would invite inauspiciousness by committing the offense of considering Lord Caitanya as simply a <em>sannyāsī</em> or considering that He was obligated to accept such symbols and that they would thereby meet with obstacles in understanding that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nityānanda broke the one <em>daṇḍa</em> into three <em>daṇḍas</em>. This pastime of Śrī Nityānanda was meant to reveal that the principles of <em>tridaṇḍa</em>, entailing control of the body, mind, and speech, are to be respected by those whose senses are not controlled; that <em>ekadaṇḍa</em> is the combined form of the <em>tridaṇḍa</em>; and that it is the duty of <em>paramahaṁsas</em> to renounce the <em>daṇḍa</em>. The tendency of <em>tridaṇḍīs</em> is to neither aspire for anyone's blessing nor to award anyone worldly blessings. Those who are bound by mundane conceptions have little interest in pursuing spiritual life. If such people relegate Śrī Gaurasundara to relative roles like <em>daṇḍena-daṇḍī</em>, or a <em>sannyāsī</em> because of carrying a <em>daṇḍa</em>, they will achieve inauspiciousness.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.225</p><p><strong>TEXT 225</strong></p><p>prabhu bale,—“yāhe sarva-deva-adhiṣṭhāna<br />se tomāra mate ki haila vāṁśa-khāna!”</p><p><strong>The Lord said, “All the demigods reside in the <em>daṇḍa</em>, and You call it a piece of bamboo!”</strong></p><p>According to spiritual consideration one should respect the supremely pure <em>tridaṇḍa</em>, which is a worshipable form of the three <em>guṇa-avatāras</em>.

Śrī Rāmānuja preached unalloyed Vaiṣṇava-dharma four hundred years before the advent of Śrī Caitanya. Those who synthesize matter and spirit try hard to equate the <em>guṇa-avatāras</em> with Vāsudeva Viṣṇu. As a result, they commit offenses at the feet of the Supreme Lord. To release such people from their offenses, Śrī Lakṣmaṇa-deśika vigorously and single-handedly preached the topics of devotional service to Viṣṇu. Veteran Vaiṣṇavas headed by Śrī Anandatīrtha worshiped the <em>guṇa-avatāras</em> Brahmā and Śiva as devotees of the Supreme Lord. Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya visited the temple of Śiva, the incarnation of a devotee, and prayed for devotional service to Kṛṣṇa. But if Mahādeva, the best of the devotees, is disrespected on the basis of the unalloyed principles of Śrī Rāmānuja by those who are subservient to Śrī Caitanya, then because of exhibiting envy of a devotee, pure devotees headed by the author become angry at such envious people. They disrespect Lord Śiva's position as the supreme Vaisnava, which is substantiated as follows: <em>śiva-viriñci-nutaṁśaraṇyam</em>—“The Supreme Lord is honored by powerful demigods like Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā;”<em>dāsāste hara-nārada-prabhṛtayaḥ</em>—“Personalities like Śiva and Nārada are His servants;” <em>vaiṣṇavānāṁ yathāśambhuḥ</em>—“Śambhu, Lord Śiva, is the greatest of all devotees of Lord Viṣṇu;” Śiva is the best among the twelve Vaiṣṇava authorities; and he is the original spiritual master of the Viṣṇusvāmī-sampradāya. Furthermore, those people think that since the Liṅgayet community or the worshipers of Śiva unnecessarily attack Vaiṣṇavas, when the Vaiṣṇavas go to see Lord Śiva at a Śiva temple where Śaivites are engaged in his worship, they have lost the association of <em>sādhus</em> who are <em>svajātīyāśaya-snigdha</em>, or “pleasing to the same class of people.” The followers of Śrī Caitanya do not think like this.</p><p>In the <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> (4.24.28) Lord Śiva speaks the following words:</p><p>yaḥ paraṁ raṁhasaḥ sākṣāt<br />tri-guṇāj jīva-saṁjñitāt<br />bhagavantaṁ vāsudevaṁ<br />prapannaḥ sa priyo hi me</p><p>“Any person who is surrendered to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, the controller of everything—material nature as well as the living entity—is actually very dear to me.”</p><p>And in the <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> (4.4.13-14) Satī speaks as follows:</p><p>nāścaryam etad yad asatsu sarvadā<br />mahad-vinindā kuṇapātma-vādiṣu<br />serṣyaṁ mahāpūruṣa-pāda-pāṁsubhir<br />nirasta-tejaḥsu tad eva śobhanam</p><p>“It is not wonderful for persons who have accepted the transient material body as the self to engage always in deriding great souls.

Just as Śrī Gaurasundara cheated such <em>prākṛta-sahajiyās</em> by approving of their activities when He met them, the most pure spiritual master of this fallen soul also recently cheated many people interested in material enjoyment by following the example set by Śrī Caitanya. People interested in material enjoyment think that the Vaiṣṇavas hanker after name and fame as they do. Such <em>prākṛta-sahajiyās</em> or sinful <em>śāktas</em> also know that when they spread their network of wicked motives to compel the Vaiṣṇavas to become attached householders by tempting them with household comforts, the most independent Vaiṣṇavas will rebuke them with angry words. The Vaiṣṇavas never visit the homes of <em>prākṛta-sahajiyās</em>. The most independent pure Vaiṣṇavas never participate in any gathering arranged by any <em>prākṛta-sahajiyā</em>. Foolish people think that the supremely liberated <em>mahā-bhāgavatas</em> support their sinful activities, but the actual aim of Śrī Gaurasundara and His devotees is to deceive them by remaining aloof from their bad association.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.272</p><p><strong>TEXT 272</strong></p><p>śuniyā calilāśākta hai' haraṣita<br />ei mata īśvarera agādha carita</p><p><strong>On hearing the Lord's reply, the <em>śākta</em> departed happily.

In other's opinion the name Yājapura is derived from the word <em>yajñānuṣṭhāna</em> (“a place of sacrifice”) or <em>yājana </em>(“worship”). Śrīman Mahāprabhu made His auspicious arrival in Yājapura in A.D. 1511. The temple of Śrī Varāhadeva is situated in Yājapura. Śrīman Mahāprabhu displayed the pastime of offering obeisances, chanting, and dancing before Śrī Varāhadeva. It is described in <em>Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em> (<em>Madhya</em> 5.3-4):</p><p>calite calite āilā yājapura-grāma<br />varāha-ṭhākura dekhi' karilā praṇāma</p><p>nṛtya-gīta kaila preme bahuta stavana<br />yājapure se rātri karilā yāpana</p><p>“Walking and walking, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His party finally arrived at Yājapura, on the river Vaitaraṇī.

He passed that night in the temple.”</p><p>In <em>Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em> there is an indication that Mahāprabhu came to Yājapura another time. In the year when Śrīman Mahāprabhu had a disagreement with Śrīla Gadādhara Paṇḍita Gosvāmī Prabhu regarding his residing in Nīlācala as a resident <em>sannyāsī</em>, Śrī Gaurasundara came to Yājapura with Śrī Rāya Rāmānanda and the two Mahāpātras, Maṅgarāja and Haricandana. Mahāprabhu then bid farewell to the two Mahāpātras at Yājapura. (See <em>Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em>, <em>Madhya-līlā</em>, Chapter Sixteen, verse 150.)</p><p>The two stone Deities of Śrī Varāhadeva are attached to each other. On the left of the Deities there is a stone deity of Śrī Lakṣmī, and on her left there is a Deity of Śrī Jagannāthadeva. In front of them there is a smaller set of Lakṣmī-Varāha deities made of metal. From the Yājapura Road railway station one must take three buses and cross two rivers to travel the seventeen miles to the temple of Varāhadeva. On both banks of both rivers there are connecting buses waiting to transport passengers. After traveling nine miles in one bus, one crosses the first river called Yamunā Khāi. Then one has to walk six miles to the next river called Buḍā. After crossing this river, one catches a connecting bus. There is a <em>dharmaśālā</em> in Yājapura known as Rādhābāi Dharmaśālā or Jagannātha Dharmaśālā. It is situated near the ancient temple of Jagannātha. The footprints of Śrī Caitanya were established in Yājapura on December 25, 1930.

For a description of Sākṣi-gopāla, one should read <em>Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em>, <em>Madhya-līlā</em>, Chapter Five.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.305</p><p><strong>TEXT 305</strong></p><p>yāra mantre sakala mūrtite vaise prāṇa<br />sei prabhu—śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanyacandra nāma</p><p><strong>Life is invoked in the Deity forms of the Supreme Lord by chanting His holy names.

Without chanting the Lord's holy names, the concept that the <em>arcā-vigraha</em> is made of stone does not disappear. The rules and regulations for worship that Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanyadeva prescribed according to the concepts of the <em>kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ</em> verse consist of lively and proper worship of the Lord's Deity, based simply on chanting the <em>mahā-mantra</em>. Wherever the Lord's service is performed without the physical involvement of the worshiper or wherever the worship is performed as a matter of formality, such worship and such deities are devoid of life. Chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <em>mahā-mantra</em> preached by Śrī Gaurasundara is the topmost lively form of worship for a worshiper.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.306</p><p><strong>TEXT 306</strong></p><p>tathāpiha niravadhi kare dāsya-līlā<br />avatāra haile haya ei mata khelā</p><p><strong>Yet in this incarnation the Lord always relished enacting pastimes as a servant.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.307</p><p><strong>TEXT 307</strong></p><p>tabe prabhu āilena śrī-bhuvaneśvara<br />gupta-kāśī-vāsa yathā karena śaṅkara</p><p><strong>Thereafter the Lord went to Śrī Bhuvaneśvara, known also as Gupta-kāśī, where Lord Śaṅkara resides.</strong></p><p>A description of the holy place Śrī Bhuvaneśvara is found in various literatures like <em>Svarṇādri-mahodaya</em>, <em>Ekāmra Purāṇa</em>, <em>Skanda Purāṇa</em>, and other Sanskrit <em>Purāṇas</em>. In those literatures this place is addressed by various names like Bhuvaneśvara, Ekāmraka-kṣetra, Hemācala, Svarṇādri-kṣetra.</p><p>Being requested by some sages, Vyāsa Bhagavān revealed the glories of the rarely attained Ekāmraka-kṣetra. This place has been known as Ekāmraka-kṣetra because long ago there was a huge mango tree there. There are ten million Śiva-liṅgas and eight <em>tīrthas</em> at this place. This place is superior to Vārāṇasī and is more dear to Śambhu, the best of the Vaiṣṇavas.</p><p>In Orissa, on the shore of the southern ocean, there is a river named Gandhavatī that flows east. This river is nondifferent from the Ganges. The transcendental abode named Ekāmraka-tīrtha is situated on the bank of this most sacred river. This place is more pleasing than Kailāsa.</p><p>The length and breadth of this place are three <em>yojanas</em> (twenty-four miles). Eight miles of this place is worshipable to the demigods, and two miles of this place was covered by the shade of that mango tree. Since time immemorial at this place pious persons have taken bath, chanted mantras, performed sacrifices, offered oblations, performed <em>abhiṣeka</em>, offered worship, offered prayers, accepted <em>prasāda</em> garlands, heard the <em>Purāṇas</em>, served the lotus feet of the Lord's devotees, and executed the nine forms of devotional service.</p><p>In the <em>Svarṇādri-mahodaya</em> it is stated that Lord Puruṣottama is the maintainer of this place. The eternal Supreme Brahman is eternally present at this place in the form of the <em>liṅga </em>“Tribhuvaneśvara.” According to the statement, <em>liṅgyate jñāyate yasmāt,</em> the Supreme Brahman resides in the state of Orissa in the form of a <em>liṅga</em> within a sacred gold mountain surrounded by the demigods. Since Nārāyaṇa personally protects this place with a <em>cakra</em> and club in His hands, He is the <em>kṣetra-pāla,</em> or protector of this place.</p><p>It is further stated in the <em>Svarṇādri-mahodaya</em> that Lord Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva personally protects this place with a <em>cakra</em> and a club in His hands. Pious activities performed without first taking <em>darśana</em> of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva yield no results. Only those who have unflinching devotion for Lord Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva are able to attain the mercy of Śrī Bhuvaneśvara, who is very dear to Ananta Vāsudeva.</p><p>When Bhuvaneśvarī Bhagavatī heard from the mouth of Śambhu the glories of Ekāmraka-tīrtha, which is superior to Vārāṇasī, she expressed a desire to visit that place. Śambhu then told Bhuvaneśvarī, “You first go there alone, and I will meet you there later.” Having received her husband's permission, she rode on her lion carrier and soon arrived at Svarṇādri. When she arrived there, she saw that it was indeed more pleasing than Kailāsa. She also saw a great <em>liṅga</em> emanating white and black effulgence. Bhuvaneśvarī began to worship that great <em>liṅga</em> with all ingredients. One day after Bhuvaneśvarī had gone to another forest to pick flowers, she returned and saw one thousand cows as white as jasmine flowers come out of a lake and begin to lavishly bathe that great <em>liṅga</em> with milk. After circumambulating the <em>liṅga</em>, they returned to where they had come from. When she saw the same incident on another occasion, she took the form of a cowherd girl and began to follow those cows. She passed fifteen years in this way.</p><p>While wandering in that forest one day, two young demon brothers named Kṛtti and Vāsa became captivated by the unprecedented beauty of that cowherd girl and expressed to her their self-destructive, wicked intentions.</p><p>Satī immediately disappeared from the sight of the two demons and remembered the lotus feet of Śambhu. As soon as Bhagavatī remembered Mahādeva, he immediately took the form of a cowherd boy and appeared before the cowherd-girl form of Satī. Satī, in the form of a cowherd girl, offered obeisances to Śambhu, who had taken the form of a cowherd boy. Mahādeva said, “O Satī, I understand why you remembered me. There is no need to feel anxiety. By the will of the Supreme Lord these two demons have expressed wicked intentions to you to invite their own ruination. Let me explain their history to you in detail. There was once a king named Drumila who performed many sacrifices and thereby pleased the demigods. The demigods gave him the benediction that he would have two sons named Kṛtti and Vāsa, who would not be killed by any weapons. So now, by the will of the Supreme Lord, you will have to kill those two sinful demons.”</p><p>Being ordered by her husband, Satī began to wander about within the forest in her form as a cowherd girl and within a short time she met those two demons. To deceive them, Satī said to the two demon brothers, “I can fulfill your desires, but I have a condition. I will become the wife of he who can carry me on his shoulder.”</p><p>On hearing Satī's statement, the two intoxicated brothers began to quarrel between themselves. Then Satī in her form as a cowherd girl placed her two feet on the shoulders of the two brothers and assumed the form of Viśvambharī. Who has the power to carry the heavy burden of Viśvambharī? By the weight of Satī, the two demons were crushed and destroyed. This Purāṇic incident concludes by stating that since that time Satī and Śambhu, the husband of Satī, left their golden temple in Kāśī and have been living in this Ekāmraka forest.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.308</p><p><strong>TEXT 308</strong></p><p>sarva-tīrtha-jala yathā bindu bindu āni'<br />`bindu-sarovara' śiva sṛjilā āpani</p><p><strong>Śiva brought drops of water from all the holy places and created the lake known as Bindu-sarovara.</strong></p><p>After killing the two demons Kṛtti and Vāsa by crushing them under her feet, Bhuvaneśvarī in the form of a cowherd girl fell asleep with an intense thirst. To quench Bhuvaneśvarī's thirst, Mahādeva pierced a mountain with the tip of his trident and created a well. This well became renowned as Śaṅkara-vāpī, Lord Śiva's well. Yet Bhuvaneśvarī desired to drink water from a properly established reservoir. Śambhu thus sent his bull carrier to bring water from all the holy places and to invite Brahmā to establish that reservoir by performing a sacrifice. Being invited by the bull carrier, Brahmā and other demigods came to this place and offered their obeisances to Bhuvaneśvara. The bull then brought waters of the Mandākinī and other sources from heaven; he brought waters from Prayāga, Puṣkara, Gaṅgā, Gaṅgādvara, Naimiṣa, Prabhāsa, Pitṛ-tīrtha, Gaṅgā-sāgara-saṅgama, Payoṣṇī, Vipāśā, Śatadru, Kāverī, Gomatī, Kṛṣṇā, Yamunā, Sarasvatī, Gaṇḍakī, Ṛṣikulyā, Mahānadī, and other sources from earth; and he brought waters from the milk ocean and other sources from Pātāla. When Bhuvaneśvara saw all the <em>tīrthas</em> assembled there, he took up his trident, pierced a mountain, and said, “I have decided to create a lake at this place. All of you offer one drop of water into this lake.” After the <em>tīrthas</em> followed the order of Śambhu, Lord Janārdana and the demigods headed by Brahmā took bath therein. Bhuvaneśvara and his followers also happily entered into those waters. Bhuvaneśvara then said, “Now two pure reservoirs of water, Śaṅkara-vāpī and Bindu-sarovara, have been established. If one takes bath in Śaṅkara-vāpī, one will attain the same features as mine, and if one takes bath in Bindu-sarovara, one will attain my abode.”</p><p>Thereafter the topmost Vaiṣṇava Śambhu offered his obeisances to Janārdana and said, “O Puruṣottama, please reside with Ananta as two Deities on the eastern bank of this lake and take the positions of my controller and the protector of this abode.” Since then Lord Ananta Vāsudeva has been blessing His dear Śaṅkara by giving him His remnants and residing on the eastern bank of Bindu-sarovara as Śambhu's controller and the protector of this abode. Thus Bhuvaneśvara Śambhu is worshiped by offerings of Śrī Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva's remnants.</p><p>In the <em>Svarṇādri-mahodaya</em> it is stated that this Bindu-sarovara is also known by the name Maṇikarṇī, and it is the essence of all <em>tīrthas</em>. If a person takes <em>darśana</em> of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva after taking a bath in this essence of all <em>tīrthas</em> Maṇikarṇī, he will certainly go to Vaikuṇṭhaloka. By giving charity to <em>brāhmaṇas</em> and Vaiṣṇavas at this place one obtains a hundred times the fruits obtained at other holy places, and by offering oblations here to the forefathers with the remnants of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva the souls of one's forefathers obtain inexhaustible satisfaction. Taking a bath in this Bindu-sarovara is equal to taking a bath at all holy places. By taking <em>darśana</em> of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva after taking bath, one attains unlimited fruits.</p><p>Festivals like Śrī Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva and Śrī Śrī Madana-mohana's Candana-yātrā and boat pastimes are held in this Bindu-sarovara.</p><p>The ancient temple of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva is still present today on the eastern bank of Bindu-sarovara. This temple is decorated by fine art and architecture. The Deity of Śrī Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva Viṣṇu was established in this large temple beautified by fine art and architecture by Śrī Bhavadeva Bhaṭṭa, a resident of Siddhala-grāma. Learned scholars of the Sāvarṇa dynasty were given many villages by the king. Siddhala-grāma was the best of those villages. In this village the three great souls Mahādeva, Bhavadeva (the first), and Aṭṭahāsa took birth. Of them, Bhavadeva became most prominent and popular. He received the village Hastinī from the King of Gauḍa. He had eight sons headed by Rathāṅga. The son of Rathāṅga was Atyaṅga, the son of Atyaṅga was Budha, and the son of Budha was Ādideva, who became the Gauḍa king's prime minister. Ādideva's son Govardhana married a girl from the Bandyaghaṭiya family. From her womb the second Bhavadeva took birth. This Bhavadeva was greatly learned in <em>tantra</em>, mathematics, astrology, and <em>āyur-veda</em>. Books on astrology, logic, and <em>mīmāṁsā </em>written by him have become well known in the society of learned scholars. On the strength of this Bhavadeva's counsel, Harivarmadeva and his son enjoyed ruling the kingdom for a long time. This Bhavadeva Bhaṭṭa established many reservoirs of water in various places of Rāḍha-deśa, which is generally bereft of water. It was he who established the Deity form of Śrī Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva Viṣṇu in a newly built temple and who had Bindu-sarovara dredged clean. He was decorated with the title Bāla-vallabhī-bhujaṅga. This information is found in the description of Bhavadeva Bhaṭṭa's dynasty engraved in stone within the Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva temple. The poet named Śrī Vācaspati, a dear friend of Bhavadeva, wrote this information in poem. This stone inscription was preserved within the temple until the middle of the nineteenth century. Thereafter Colonel Kiṭo Sāheba attached this stone inscription along with the Megheśvara inscription to the wall of the Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva temple. The dimensions of this stone inscription are two cubits, two inches long and one cubit, one inch wide (a cubit is about a foot and a half). There are twenty-five lines of inscription on the stone. Each letter measures about a half inch.</p><p>In the sixth and seventh chapters of the <em>Svarṇādri-mahodaya</em>, Mahādeva says, “O Brahmā, you should come with the other demigods to Ekāmraka forest and faithfully worship the ancient <em>liṅga</em> with various transcendental ingredients. After the completion of the worship you should faithfully honor his remnants.”</p><p>After hearing the order of Mahādeva, Brahmā asked, “O Maheśvara, we do not know your glories. The sages say that the remnants of a <em>liṅga</em> should not be honored. Therefore how can we accept those remnants?”</p><p>Vyāsa said, “Although the remnants of a <em>liṅga</em> are not to be accepted, Śrī Bhuvaneśvara is not a <em>liṅga</em>, he is the eternal Supreme Brahman. Statements that prohibit one from honoring Śiva's remnants are not applicable to Bhuvaneśvara. The demigods honor the remnants of Bhuvaneśvara to cross the material ocean. Foodstuffs offered to Bhuvaneśvara should be honored with the understanding that they are transcendental. As far as the acceptance of Bhuvaneśvara's remnants is concerned, there should not be any discrimination whether one is a <em>brāhmaṇa</em>, <em>kṣatriya</em>, <em>vaiśya</em>, <em>śūdra</em>, or outcaste, otherwise one will certainly go to hell. On receiving Bhuvaneśvara's <em>prasāda</em>, one should immediately honor it. Bhuvaneśvara's <em>prasāda</em> is never contaminated by contact with impure living entities. One should distribute this <em>prasāda</em> to the demigods, forefathers, and <em>brāhmaṇas</em>. The result one obtains by giving charity in Kurukṣetra during the solar or lunar eclipse is attained by distributing the remnants of Bhuvaneśvara. Whether it is dry, stale, or brought from a distant place, simply by honoring Bhuvaneśvara's <em>prasāda</em> one is delivered from all unwanted habits. By honoring Bhuvaneśvara's <em>prasāda</em> one attains the result of seeing, worshiping, meditating on, or hearing about Viṣṇu. There is a possibility of taking birth again after drinking nectar, but there is no rebirth for one who honors Bhuvaneśvara's <em>prasāda</em>. By seeing Bhuvaneśvara's <em>prasāda</em> one's desires are fulfilled, by touching it to one's head one's sinful reactions are destroyed, by honoring it one counteracts the reactions of eating nonvegetarian food, by smelling it the sins committed in one's mind are destroyed, by seeing it one's vision is purified, by smearing it on one's limbs the body is purified, by eating it to one's full satisfaction one attains the result of observing an Ekādaśī without water, and by honoring it with full respect one attains the devotional service of Viṣṇu.”</p><p>When the sages inquired further, Vyāsa said, “In the <em>Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa</em>, Brahmā said to Nārada, `What to speak of human beings, even the demigods headed by Brahmā accept human forms and beg for Bhuvaneśvara's remnants. There is no consideration of rules and regulations or auspicious or inauspicious times in the eating of Bhuvaneśvara's <em>prasāda</em>. If one accepts Bhuvaneśvara's <em>prasāda</em> that has been touched by a most fallen person, one attains the abode of Viṣṇu. Those who criticize Bhuvaneśvara's <em>prasāda</em> by comparing it to the ordinary <em>prasāda</em> of a Śiva-liṅga certainly go to hell. Gaurī, the greatest Vaiṣṇavī, cooks Bhuvaneśvara's offerings, and the eternal Supreme Brahman eats it. Therefore there is no consideration of any contamination in it because of contact with impure living entities. You should know that it is completely transcendental. If the remnants of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva and the <em>mahā-mahā-prasāda</em> of Śrī Bhuvaneśvara is touched by the mouth of a dog or brought from a place where nonvegetarian foods are kept, it is to be accepted by even the best of the <em>brāhmaṇas</em>. By eating the remnants of this transcendental <em>liṅga</em> one attains Lord Viṣṇu's shelter, which is rare for even personalities like Brahmā and Indra. Those who blaspheme persons who eat such <em>mahā-prasāda</em> will continue to live in hell for as long as the sun and moon shine in the sky. Whether one has taken bath or not, simply by honoring Bhuvaneśvara's <em>mahā-prasāda</em> one becomes purified externally and internally. With His thousand mouths even Anantadeva is unable to describe the glories of this <em>mahā-mahā-prasāda</em>, which is the remnants of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva's remnants. One can please Bhuvaneśvara simply by hearing the glories of this <em>prasāda</em>, and if Bhuvaneśvara is pleased Govinda is also pleased.'”</p><p>Everyday after the completion of Śrī Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva's worship and offering, Śrī Bhuvaneśvara accepts his own worship and offering. This system is still current in Bhuvaneśvara. Apart from this, he teaches Viṣṇu's devotional service to the people of the entire world while setting the example of giving up material enjoyment for the pleasure of Kṛṣṇa by his own behavior of not riding on the chariot or going out during the Candana-yātrā or boat festival but offering these conveyances and various other enjoyable ingredients to his eternal Lords, Śrī Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva and Śrī Śrī Madana-mohana. Whenever it is mentioned that Śrī Bhuvaneśvara rides on an airplane or chariot, it is to be understood that the pleasure of Śrī Śrī Madana-mohana and Śrī Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva was the purpose of all such occasions.</p><p>The <em>pāṇḍās </em>(priests) of Bhuvaneśvara call Śrī Śrī Madana-mohana the <em>pratinidhi</em>, or “representative,” of Bhuvaneśvara. In this context the word “representative” does not mean subordinate as it is normally understood in the relationship between a king and his representative. According to the consideration of servitorship, or <em>śakti-tattva</em>, Śrī Bhuvaneśvara does not personally accept any items of enjoyment but offers them to his only Lord, the supremely independent Śrī Madana-mohana, who is the source of all energies and the proprietor of all enjoyable objects. In other words, because he does not independently enjoy but rather gives enjoyment to his Lord, his Lord is addressed as his “representative.” Rather than accept worship for himself, Bhuvaneśvara accepts worship on behalf of his Lords, Śrī Madana-mohana and Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva. Even if he ever does accept any service for himself, he accepts it as a servant of Śrī Madana-mohana or Śrī Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva. He does not independently accept any service.</p><p>The Deity of Śrī Madana-mohana situated in Śrī Bhuvaneśvara is not two-armed but is four-armed. On Madana-mohana's upper left hand there is an impression of a deer, on His upper right hand there is an impression of an ax, His lower left hand displays the sign of fearlessness, and His lower right hand displays the sign of awarding benediction. Śrī Madana-mohana, Śrī Govinda, a five-headed Mahādeva, Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva's <em>vijaya-mūrti</em>, a four-armed Harihara <em>mūrti</em>, and ŚrīŚālagrāma are worshiped in a temple south of the original Bhuvaneśvara temple.</p><p>Among the committee members who look after the service of the Śrī Bhuvaneśvara temple are Śrīyukta Priyanātha Caṭṭopādhyāya, a lawyer from Cuttack; Śrīyukta Gaṅgādhara Chaudhurī, a landlord from Purī district; and Śrīyukta Gopāla Prahararāja, another lawyer from Cuttack. This committee has employed a manager. The name of the present manager is Śrīyukta Lachman Rāmānuja dāsa. The manager takes care of the income and expenditure for the various services in the Bhuvaneśvara temple with the help of the four following head <em>pāṇḍās</em>: Jagannātha Mahāpātra, Nārāyaṇa Makadama, Dāmodara Sāntarā, and Sadaya Mahāpātra.</p><p>As a <em>patita-pāvana mūrti </em>is established within the lion gate of the Śrī Jagannātha temple for the benefit of fallen souls outside the <em>varṇāśrama </em>system, there is also a <em>patita-pāvana mūrti </em>within the lion gate of the Śrī Bhuvaneśvara temple. Within the lion gate there is a market known as Ānanda-bazaar. As in the Purī Ānanda-bazaar, items like <em>prasāda</em> are also bought and sold here. Like Jagannātha <em>prasāda</em>, the <em>prasāda</em> here is not contaminated by contact with impure living entities. After crossing the lion gate there is a Garuḍa-stambha, on the top of which a bull and Garuḍa are situated. As in the Jagannātha temple there also is a Deity of Nṛsiṁhadeva at the entrance here. This four-armed Deity of Nṛsiṁhadeva is in a peaceful mood. In His upper right hand He holds a <em>cakra</em>, in His upper left hand He holds a conch, and in His lower two hands He holds the <em>Vedas</em>. Śrī Lakṣmīdevī is sitting on His lap. South of the original temple is Bhuvaneśvara's kitchen. There is an order that the rays of the sun and moon should not fall on it. <em>Brāhmaṇa</em> <em>pāṇḍās</em> from three hundred sixty families cook here. The deity of Śrī Bhuvaneśvara within the main temple is a combined form of Śrī Hari and Hara. The <em>pāṇḍās</em> show everyone this Śrī Bhuvaneśvara deity, which has a black and white form. The form of Śrī Bhuvaneśvara is shaped like a <em>cakra</em> and has impressions of Gaṅgā, Yamunā, and Sarasvatī as well as the ten incarnations beginning with Matsya and Kūrma.</p><p>The wonderful artistic work of Bhuvaneśvara temple attracts the attention of common people who come for <em>darśana</em>. After seeing the artistry and architectural work of the Bhuvaneśvara temple, the Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva temple, and the many other temples in Bhuvaneśvara, one can realize how advanced Indian art was at one time. The Bhuvaneśvara temple is one hundred sixty-five feet tall. This temple is situated on a huge stone slab three hundred yards south of Bindu-sarovara. The dimensions of the temple are five hundred twenty by four hundred sixty-five feet. Apart from this, there is a twenty-eight foot exterior hall north of the temple. The main hall measures two hundred thirty-five feet. The temple walls are seven foot five inch thick. There are large gates on the four sides of the temple. The eastern gate is the largest of the four and is called the Siṁha-dvāra, or the lion gate. There are two large lions on the two sides of the entrance. Within the courtyard there is twenty-foot long, four-foot high stone slab wall. This unbreakable stone wall was built to protect the temple from outside attack. The Deity of Śrī Nṛsiṁhadeva is situated on one side of this wall. There are many small Śiva temples within the western courtyard. Among those temples there is a twenty-foot tall temple. This temple is older than the main temple. The altar of this temple is five feet below the ground level of the temple. It is said that the original Śiva-liṅga is situated here. Even after the main temple was built the original <em>liṅga</em> was not transferred from here. There is a temple of Bhuvaneśvarī in one corner of the western courtyard. On one side of the expansive stone slab found after one enters the Siṁha-dvāra there is a temple of Gopālinī, Satī's form as a cowherd girl. Although the ground level of the Gopālinī temple is lower than the ground level of the main temple, it is at the same level as the original <em>liṅga</em>. There are six stone steps west of the Gopālinī temple. Above those steps and below Bhuvaneśvara's kitchen there is a deity of Vṛṣabha, the bull carrier.</p><p>The <em>bhoga-maṇḍapa</em>, or hall where offerings are made, is situated directly in front of the Bhuvaneśvara temple. Behind the hall is the <em>nātya-mandira </em>(the hall where drama, dance, and <em>kīrtana</em> are performed), behind the <em>nātya-mandira </em>is the <em>jagamohana </em>(the area directly in front of the central altar), behind the <em>jagamohana </em>is the main temple, and within this is the <em>garbha-gṛha</em>, where the deity is situated. According to the conclusion of Rājā Rājendralāla Mitra, the <em>bhoga-maṇḍapa</em> was built during Kamala Keśarī's rule, which lasted from A.D. 792 to 811. But other archeologists say that the Gaṅgā dynasty King Narasiṁhadeva, who built the sun temple at Konark, built the offering hall in the twenty-four years of his rule. By reading the inscription found on the door of the <em>nātya-mandira</em> one can understand that Mahārāja Kapilendradeva, who conquered Karnataka, arranged to donate a vast tract of land for the service of Bhuvaneśvara. According to the opinion of many archeologists this <em>nātya-mandira</em> was built many years before the time of Kapilendradeva. Rājā Rājendralāla Mitra said Śālinīkeśarī's queen built this <em>nātya-mandira</em> between A.D. 1099 and 1104, but many archeologists disagree with this. On the right side of the entrance to the deity room there is a inscription that says that Narasiṁhadeva built the Konark sun temple and its entrance. The <em>nātya-mandira</em> and the entrance of the Bhuvaneśvara temple are certainly the glorious work of that valiant Gaṅgā dynasty king. Since the name of that king's daughter is mentioned in that inscription, many people think that the Gaṅgā dynasty king's daughter built it. Some people guess that this king's daughter has been described in the <em>Mādalā-paṅji </em>calendar as Śālinīkeśarī's queen.</p><p>The expertise, artistry, and architectural work in the construction of the <em>jagamohana</em> are superb. The roof of the <em>jagamohana,</em> like the roof of the offering hall, is shaped like a pinnacle. This roof is supported by four giant thirty-foot-tall stone pillars. Left of its southern entrance is a rectangular room decorated with adequate artistic work, but the builder of this room could not complete the work. There are a few brass deities within this room. They are Bhuvaneśvara's <em>vijaya-mūrtis</em>, which are taken out during festivals. The Bhuvaneśvara temple is one hundred sixty feet tall from the ground to the <em>kalasa</em>, but since the deity room is two feet lower than ground level, the eastern courtyard is two to three feet below that. So at one time the height of the dome must have been one hundred sixty-five feet.</p><p>Apart from the Liṅgarāja Śrī Bhuvaneśvara temple and the Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva temple, there are many other temples situated in the four directions within Bhuvaneśvara. It has already been stated that the Bhuvaneśvara temple is 160 feet tall from the ground level to the <em>kalasa</em>. The Ananta Vāsudeva temple is 60 foot tall. The Rameśvara temple is 78 feet tall, Yameśvara is 67 feet, Rājārāṇī is 63 feet, Bhagavatī is 54 feet, Sārīdeula is 53 feet, Nāgeśvara is 52 feet, Siddheśvara is 47 feet, Kapileśvara is 64 feet, Kedāreśvara is 46 feet, Paraśurāmeśvara is 38 feet, Mukteśvara is 35 feet, and Kopāri is 35 feet tall.</p><p>Many people think that the Bhuvaneśvara temple is older than the Jagannātha Purī temple and that the artistic work of the Purī temple is an imitation of the Bhuvaneśvara temple.</p><p>Rājā Rājendralāla Mitra said that King Yayāti Keśarī came from Magadha, drove away the Yavanas, and reestablished Hindu religion over the ruins of the Buddhist religion. The duration of Yayāti Keśarī's rule extended from A.D. 474 to 526. Construction of the Bhuvaneśvara temple and the <em>jagamohana</em> began near the end of Yayāti Keśarī's rule. Yayāti Keśarī could not complete the construction work. Although his descendent Sūrya Keśarī ruled the kingdom for a long time, he did not try to complete the temple. His heir, Ananta Keśarī, again started the temple construction. The Bhuvaneśvara temple was eventually completed during the reign of Lalāṭendu Keśarī in 588 Śakābda (A.D. 666). Regarding this, Rājā Rājendralāla Mitra has quoted the following verse:</p><p>gajāṣṭeṣum ite jāte   śakābde kīrti vāsasah<br />prāsādam akarod rājā   lalāṭenduś ca keśarī</p><p>But some archeologists do not agree with the statement of Mitra Mahāśaya. They say that the stone inscription is similar to the unverified handwritten verses found that describe the construction of the Jagannātha temple and that there is no historical truth in it. They further say that the description Rājā Rājendralāla Mitra quoted from Jagannātha's <em>Mādalā-pañji </em>calendar is a futile attempt by the <em>pāṇḍās</em>, who are ignorant of historical facts, to prove that this holy place is more ancient than it actually is. The exact date of the construction of the Bhuvaneśvara temple and <em>jagamohana</em> is found in a stone inscription carved at the time of that construction. The famous Anaṅga-bhīma, who is said to be the builder of the Śrī Puruṣottama temple, is also described in that stone inscription to be the builder of the Bhuvaneśvara temple. Thirty-four years of Anaṅga-bhīma are described in that stone inscription. In the stone inscription of Cāteśvara and in the royal inscription on a copper plate of the second Narasiṁhadeva the names of two persons called Anaṅga-bhīma, or Aniyaṅka-bhīma, are found. The first Anaṅga-bhīma was the fourth son of Cauḍa Gaṅgā. He ruled the kingdom for ten years. He conquered Orissa and built the temple of Śrī Puruṣottama. The second Anaṅga-bhīma was the grandson of the first Anaṅga-bhīma and the son of Rājarāja. He ruled the kingdom for thirty-four years up to A.D. 1253. Since the stone inscription in the Bhuvaneśvara temple mentions thirty-four years in connection with Aniyaṅka-bhīma, the son of Rājarāja, some archeologists ascertain the second Aniyaṅka-bhīma, or Anaṅga-bhīma, as the actual builder of the Bhuvaneśvara temple. This second Aniyaṅka-bhīma built many large temples in Cuttack and many places in the districts of Purī and Gañjāma.</p><p>We have already discussed something about the temple of Ananta Vāsudeva, situated on the eastern bank of the Bindu-sarovara in front of the middle <em>ghāṭa</em>. This temple is one hundred thirty-one feet long and one hundred seventeen feet wide. The main hall is ninety-six feet long and twenty-five feet wide. Adjacent to the main temple is the <em>jagamohana</em>, behind that is the <em>nātya-mandira</em>, and behind that is the <em>bhoga-maṇḍapa</em>. From ground level to the <em>kalasa</em>, the temple is sixty feet tall. Inside the <em>nātya-mandira</em> is a deity of Garuḍa made of black stone. The Deity of Ananta Vāsudeva Viṣṇu is situated within the main temple. This temple of Ananta Vāsudeva is the most ancient temple in Bhuvaneśvara. This is widely accepted by even the archeologists. No pilgrim visits the temples of deities subordinate to Śrī Vāsudeva without first taking <em>darśana</em> of Ananta Vāsudeva Viṣṇu, the Lord of all. This practice is current in Bhuvaneśvara even today. We have already learned from the verses composed by the poet Vācaspati Miśra and inscribed on a stone attached to the wall of the Ananta Vāsudeva temple that Bhavadeva Bhaṭṭa built the temple of Ananta Vāsudeva and Bindu-sarovara, which is situated in front of the temple. Vācaspati Miśra wrote a book called <em>Nyāya-sūcī-nibandha </em>in 898 Śakābda (A.D. 976). It is not improper to consider his dear friend Bhavadeva Bhaṭṭa as his contemporary. Therefore some archeologists conclude that the temple of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva was built in the tenth century.</p><p>Bindu-sarovara is thirteen hundred feet long, seven hundred feet wide, and sixteen feet deep. The four banks of this <em>sarovara,</em> or lake,<em> </em>are covered with stone slabs. There is a island built of stone in the middle of Bindu-sarovara. The island is 100x100 feet. There is a small temple in the northeast corner of the island. The festival Deity of Ananta Vāsudeva is brought here during the Snāna-yātrā. The Deity is then bathed by streams of water squirted out of fountains surrounding that temple. During the Snāna-yātrā, in other words, during the rainy season, this Bindu-sarovara becomes the residence of many large crocodiles.</p><p>Western historians like Starling, Hunter, and Cunningham, as well as archeologists of India like Rājā Rājendralāla Mitra have described Bhuvaneśvara as a principal Buddhist center. Other archeologists of India, however, have through argument and evidence like stone inscriptions found in various temples of Bhuvaneśvara and descriptions in ancient <em>Purāṇas</em> like the <em>Mahābhārata</em> demonstrated that there is no evidence to substantiate the claim that Bhuvaneśvara was a principal center for Buddhists during the time of Lord Buddha. The evidence of Buddhism found in Khaṇḍagiri and Udayagiri are from a much later time than that of Lord Buddha. Those who advertised that the elephant cave was a Buddhist cave have been proven completely wrong, because it has now been established as belonging to the Jains. The glories of the Orissan King Kharbel Bhupati, who was a follower of the Jain religion, are found on a stone inscription within this elephant cave. But there is no evidence or proof of the exact date when this Jain Kharbel established his capitol at Bhuvaneśvara. The <em>Mahābhārata</em>, <em>Vana-parva</em>, Chapter 114 states that after the confluence at Gaṅgā-sāgara comes the sacred Vaitaraṇī River in Kaliṅga. Yājapura, where Brahmā performed a sacrifice, is on the bank of this river. After that comes Svayambhu-vana, and then comes Mahāvedi, which is near the ocean and which is renowned as Puruṣottama-kṣetra. After that comes Mahendra Mountain, which is situated in Gañjāma district and which is known as the abode of Paraśurāma. The above-mentioned name Svayambhu refers to Śambhu, or Mahādeva. This is the opinion found in the ancient commentary on <em>Mahābhārata</em> known as <em>Durgaṭārtha-prakāśinī</em>. Since a long time this Svayambhu-vana was a place for ascetics to undergo austerities. It is stated in the <em>Skanda Purāṇa</em>, <em>Utkala-khaṇḍa</em>:</p><p>ittham etat purā kṣetraṁ   mahādevena nirmitam<br />tatra sākṣād umā-kāntaḥ   sthāpitaḥ parameṣṭhināyad <br />etac chāmbhavaṁ kṣetraṁ   tamaso nāśanaṁ param</p><p>“This sacred place was created long ago by Mahādeva. Brahmā personally established the husband of Pārvatī at this place. Since then this place has been known as the destroyer of ignorance and a favorite place of Śambhu. This place is also known as Ekāmraka-vana or Ekāmraka-kṣetra.”</p><p>Elsewhere in the <em>Skanda Purāṇa</em>, <em>Utkala-khaṇḍa</em>, it is stated:</p><p>sa vartate nīlagirir   yojane 'tra tṛtīyake<br />idam tv ekāmraka-vanaṁ   kṣetraṁ gaurī-pater vidhuḥ</p><p>catur deha sthito 'haṁ vai   yatra nīlamaṇi-mayaḥ<br />tasyottarasyāṁ vikhyātaṁ   vanam ekāmrakāhvayam</p><p>Ekāmraka-kanana, which is very dear to the husband of Pārvatī, is situated two <em>yojanas</em> north of Nīlācala in the state of Orissa. This Ekāmraka-kṣetra is the Svayambhu-vana described in the <em>Mahābhārata</em>, <em>Vana-parva</em>, and many thoughtful persons have concluded that this place is much older than the time of Buddha.</p><p>A description of Śrī Bhuvaneśvara deva is found in the <em>Kapila-saṁhita</em>. Long ago Lord Viśveśvara (Śiva) of Kāśī told Devarṣi Nārada that he would not reside in Kāśī any longer and that Kāśī would soon be destroyed because the atheists overwhelmed with mundane knowledge were creating disturbances there. Religious principles would no longer remain, and everyone would become irreligious. Moreover, Kāśī would gradually become crowded, and it would become difficult to perform austerities without disturbance. Although it was a fact that Mahādeva painstakingly established Kāśī for the pleasure of Pārvatī, she was no longer inclined to stay there because of the disturbances created by the atheists. Where, therefore, was the place where one could sit and perpetually worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead? After hearing these statements from Śambhu, the best of the Vaiṣṇavas, Devarṣi Nārada said that there was a famous mountain, Nīla-śaila, situated on the shore of the saltwater ocean. North of this mountain is the most pleasing Ekāmraka-kanana. Vāsudeva, the Lord of Lakṣmī, resides in that solitary forest with Ananta. That place is most confidential. On hearing Nārada's reply, Mahādeva left Kāśī and came to Ekāmraka-vana with Pārvatī. After arriving at this sacred place, Mahādeva said to Śrī Hari, “I have come to Your shelter. Please give me a place to stay near Your lotus feet.” When Śrī Vāsudeva heard the appeal of Śambhu, the topmost Vaiṣṇava, He said, “O Śambhu, I will gladly let you stay here, but you have to promise that you will never return to Kāśī.”Śaṅkara then replied, “How can I leave Kāśī forever? My beloved Jāhnavī (Gaṅgā) and Maṇikarṇikā, the aggregate of all holy places, are situated there.” Vāsudeva said, “O Śambhu, here in front of Me there is Maṇikarṇikā, which is also known as Pāpanāśinī. The river Gaṅgā-Yamunā that emanates from My lotus feet flows southeast of Me. There are many other confidential <em>tīrthas</em> here.”Śaṅkara then replied, “I promise that I will not leave Your lotus feet and go anywhere, even to Vārāṇasī.” After speaking these words, Śambhu stayed south of Viṣṇu in the form of a <em>liṅga</em>. That dark bluish <em>liṅga </em>glows like a crystal and is renowned as Tribhuvaneśvara, or Bhuvaneśvara.</p><p>A <em>pañca-krośī</em>(ten mile) Bhuvaneśvara <em>parikramā</em> is performed in the month of Kārtika. The <em>parikramā</em> starts from Varāhadevī, goes through Dhavalagiri, Khaṇḍagiri, Udayagiri, around the Bhuvaneśvara railway station, and eventually returns to the Varāhadevī temple.</p><p>Bhuvaneśvara is situated 272 miles from Howrah on the Bengal-Nagpur railway line. The Bhuvaneśvara temple is two miles from the Bhuvaneśvara station. The road is most beautiful, being covered on both sides by trees that grow in the mountains, particularly the <em>kuñcilā</em>, or Nux Vomica. No conveyance other than bullox carts is generally available, but buses and motorcars can drive on the road. There are two <em>dharmaśālās</em> in Bhuvaneśvara. On the bank of Bindu-sarovara, a Calcutta Marwari named Hazarimala has built a new large <em>dharmaśālā</em>. The other <em>dharmaśālā</em> was built by one Rāya Bahadur Hargovinda Viśveśvaralala. Pilgrims can stay for three days in those <em>dharmaśālās</em>. There is a charitable hospital, a telegraph office, and a post office. There is an open market every Monday and Thursday. Like Jagannātha <em>prasāda</em>, the <em>prasāda</em> of Śrī Ananta Vāsudeva and Bhuvaneśvara is sold.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.309</p><p><strong>TEXT 309</strong></p><p>`śiva-priya sarovara' jāni śrī-caitanya<br />snāna kari' viśeṣe karilā ati dhanya</p><p><strong>Realizing that the lake was dear to Śiva, Śrī Caitanya eagerly took bath therein and made it glorious.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.310</p><p><strong>TEXT 310</strong></p><p>dekhilena giyā prabhu prakaṭa śaṅkara<br />catur-dige śiva-dhvani kare anucara</p><p><strong>Thereafter the Lord went to see the manifestation of Śaṅkara, whose followers were glorifying him in all directions.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.311</p><p><strong>TEXT 311</strong></p><p>catur-dige sāri sāri ghṛta-dīpa jvale<br />niravadhi abhiṣeka haiteche jale</p><p><strong>There were rows of ghee lamps in the four directions, and the Śiva-liṅga was being continuously bathed with water.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.312</p><p><strong>TEXT 312</strong></p><p>nija-priya-śaṅkarera dekhiyā vibhava<br />tuṣṭa hailena prabhu, sakala vaiṣṇava</p><p><strong>The Lord and all the Vaiṣṇavas were pleased to see the influence of the Lord's dear devotee Śaṅkara.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.313</p><p><strong>TEXT 313</strong></p><p>ye caraṇa-rase śiva vasana nā jāne<br />hena prabhu nṛtya kare śiva-vidyamāne</p><p><strong>Śiva forgets to dress in the ecstasy he relishes by serving the lotus feet of that Supreme Lord who was now dancing before him.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.314</p><p><strong>TEXT 314</strong></p><p>nṛtya-gīta śiva-agre kariyā ānanda<br />se rātri rahilā sei grāme gauracandra</p><p><strong>After joyfully dancing and chanting before Śiva, Gauracandra passed that night in that village.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.315</p><p><strong>TEXT 315</strong></p><p>sei sthāna śiva pāilena yena-mate<br />sei kathā kahi skanda-purāṇera mate</p><p><strong>I will now narrate the <em>Skanda Purāṇa</em> description of how Śiva came to this place.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.316</p><p><strong>TEXT 316</strong></p><p>kāśī-madhye pūrve śiva pārvatī-sahite<br />āchilā aneka kāla parama-nibhṛte</p><p><strong>Śiva and Pārvatī had previously lived for a long time in a solitary place at Kāśī.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.317</p><p><strong>TEXT 317</strong></p><p>tabe gaurī-saha śiva gelena kailāsa<br />nara-rāja-gaṇe kāśī karaye vilāsa</p><p><strong>Then Śiva went to Kailāsa with Gaurī, and the human kings began to rule Kāśī.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.318</p><p><strong>TEXT 318</strong></p><p>tabe kāśīrāja-nāme hailā eka rājā<br />kāśīpura bhoga kare kari' śiva-pūjā</p><p><strong>There was one king named Kāśirāja, who worshiped Śiva as he enjoyed the opulence of Kāśī.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.319</p><p><strong>TEXT 319</strong></p><p>daive āsi' kālapāśa lāgila tāhāre<br />ugra-tape śiva pūje kṛṣṇe jinibāre</p><p><strong>By providence, he became bound by the ropes of time and began worshiping Śiva through severe austerities so that he could defeat Kṛṣṇa in battle.</strong></p><p>The topics of Sudakṣiṇa, the King of Kāśī, are described in the <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em>, Tenth Canto, Chapter Sixty-six as follows:</p><p>While Lord Baladeva was visiting Nanda's Vraja, King Pauṇḍraka of Karūṣa, encouraged by fools, announced that he was the real Vāsudeva and informed the Supreme Personality of Godhead Vāsudeva that no one other than he himself was Vāsudeva, and therefore Śrī Kṛṣṇa should give up both the name and the symbols of Vāsudeva and take shelter of Pauṇḍraka, otherwise He should fight with him. When Ugrasena and the members of his royal assembly heard Pauṇḍraka's foolish boast, they all laughed heartily. Śrī Kṛṣṇa told Pauṇḍraka's messenger that He would soon make that foolish king drop his artificial symbols like the Sudarśana <em>cakra</em> that he was presently carrying and his body would be eaten by dogs after it fell on the battlefield. Thereafter, when Kṛṣṇa came near Kāśī, Pauṇḍraka immediately led his army on to the battlefield with enthusiasm, and his friend Kāśirāja followed him for support. Just as the fire of universal devastation burns everything in the four directions, Śrī Kṛṣṇa began to destroy the armies of Pauṇḍraka and Kāśirāja with His weapons. Kṛṣṇa then told Pauṇḍraka that He would force him to relinquish the falsely assumed name of Vāsudeva, otherwise if He did not wish to fight He would surrender to Pauṇḍraka. After speaking these words, Kṛṣṇa destroyed Pauṇḍraka's chariot with a sharp arrow and beheaded Pauṇḍraka with His Sudarśana <em>cakra</em>. He then severed the head of Kāśirāja from his body, threw it into Kāśī, and returned to Dvārakā. Since Pauṇḍraka dressed like Śrī Hari and always remembered Kṛṣṇa, he attained liberation.</p><p>When the queen, children, and relatives of Kāśirāja saw his severed head, they began to cry. Thereafter, with a desire to take revenge on his father's killer, Sudakṣiṇa, the son of Kāśirāja, began to perform severe austerities to please Mahādeva. When Mahādeva became pleased with his austerities and desired to give him a benediction, Sudakṣiṇa requested the means to kill his father's killer. Mahādeva instructed him to worship the Dakṣiṇāgni fire according to the injunctions of the <em>abhicāra </em>ritual. After the sacrifice was completed, a formidable fiery form appeared from the sacrificial fire pit with a fiery trident in his hand. When that demon was sent to Dvārakā, the residents of Dvārakā became frightened and approached Kṛṣṇa, who was engaged in playing chess. Śrī Kṛṣṇa gave them His assurance and ordered Sudarśana <em>cakra</em> to destroy the demon created with the help of Mahādeva. When by the influence of Sudarśana <em>cakra</em> the fire created by the <em>abhicāra </em>ritual was checked, it returned to Vārāṇasī and burned the priests and Sudakṣiṇa to ashes. Sudarśana <em>cakra</em> then entered Vārāṇasī, burned the entire city, and returned to Kṛṣṇa.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.320</p><p><strong>TEXT 320</strong></p><p>pratyakṣa hailāśiva tapera prabhāve<br />`vara māga' balile, se rājā vara māge</p><p><strong>By the influence of his austerity, Śiva appeared before him and said, “Ask for a benediction.” The King then asked for the following benediction.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.320</p><p><strong>TEXT 320</strong></p><p>“eka vara māgoṅ prabhu, tomāra caraṇe<br />yena muñi kṛṣṇa jinibāre pāroṅ raṇe”</p><p><strong>“O Lord, I desire one benediction from you.

O Gopīśvara, I pray that you bestow upon me uninterrupted, unalloyed love for the lotus feet of the divine couple, who enjoy pastimes in Vraja.”</p><p>Ignorant people who do not understand either Mahādeva's glorious service to Kṛṣṇa or the actual purport of some Purāṇic incidents think that Śiva is worshiped as the supreme controller by <em>viṣṇu-tattvas </em>like Rāma and <em>lakṣmīs </em>like Sītā, and therefore Rudra is certainly the independent Supreme Lord and Lord Viṣṇu is subordinate to the Supreme Lord Rudra. Some people consider that Viṣṇu is equal to Rudra or that Viṣṇu is another name of Rudra, and they thus try to synthesize without authority. But all Vedic literatures have refuted their philosophy as follows:</p><p>yas tu nārāyaṇaṁ devaṁ<br />brahma-rudrādi-daivataiḥ<br />samatvenaiva vīkṣeta<br />sa pāṣaṇḍī bhaved dhruvam</p><p>“A person who considers demigods like Brahmā and Śiva to be on an equal level with Nārāyaṇa is to be considered an offender, or <em>pāṣaṇḍī</em>.”</p><p>In the <em>Mahābhārata</em> narration regarding Upamanyu it is said that Śrī Kṛṣṇa performed austerities to please Rudra for the sake of Jāmbavatī's son and that all the demigods and Viṣṇu emanated from Rudra. But where is the justification for this conclusion?</p><p>The understanding of those who conclude in this way without realizing the actual purport of the scriptures is extremely crude. The reason for this is that the scriptures describe that when Rudra was fighting on behalf of King Bāṇa, he was defeated by Viṣṇu and he then glorified Viṣṇu as the original Personality of Godhead. He was also bewildered by Mohinī, saved from the hands of Vṛkāsura, and delivered from the sin of killing a <em>brāhmaṇa</em>. The reason why Lord Viṣṇu sometimes displays the pastime of worshiping Rudra is described in the scriptures as follows:</p><p>In the <em>Siddhānta-ratna</em>, Third <em>Pāda</em>, texts 22, 23, 26, 27 it is stated: “By displaying the pastime of worshiping His own form as Rudra, Lord Viṣṇu taught the worship of Rudra not to His own sincere devotees but to the insincere living entities who desire religiosity, economic development, sense gratification, and liberation. This fact has been confirmed by the Lord Himself when He spoke in the <em>Nārāyaṇīya</em> to Arjuna as follows: `O Arjuna, I am the soul of the universe. My worship of Rudra is worship of My own Self. Whatever I do, common people follow. Examples set by Me should be followed. That is why I worship Rudra. Viṣṇu does not offer obeisances to any demigod. I worship Rudra, considering him to be My own Self. I am the indwelling Supersoul of the entire universe. I worship My own partial expansion, Rudra, who is nondifferent from Me as molten iron is nondifferent from fire. I have set the standard that the demigods headed by Rudra should be worshiped. If I did not set the example of worshiping Rudra, then people would not follow that standard. Therefore I teach the worship of My servants through My personal behavior. There is no one greater than or equal to Me. Therefore, since I am the greatest, I do not worship anyone. But since Rudra is My partial expansion I display the example of worshiping Rudra and other demigods to teach ordinary people.' In this connection Brahmā told Rudra that Viṣṇu alone is the Supersoul of everyone including Brahmā and Rudra. He said, `Lord Viṣṇu is the Supersoul of you, me, and all other embodied living entities. No one can restrict Him within the confines of their mundane knowledge.'</p><p>“If simply because Śrī Rāmacandra displayed the pastime of worshiping Lord Śiva to teach the worship of that great Vaiṣṇava, Śiva should be considered the Supreme Lord and Rāmacandra should be considered subordinate, then since Śrī Rāmacandra worshiped the ocean, the ocean should also be considered the Supreme Lord. It should be understood that whenever the associates of the Supreme Lord have enacted the pastime of worshiping demigods, their purpose was to teach the worship of the demigods, who are subordinate to Viṣṇu. It is the pastime of the Lord's associates to teach, `all demigods are subordinate to Viṣṇu,' yet such worship should never be accepted as the ultimate conclusion. Lord Viṣṇu is certainly the controller of everyone. His activity of maintaining the universe, like Brahmā's activity of creation and Rudra's activity of annihilation, and His interaction with the demigods is just like a king's interaction with thieves. Actually Brahmā and Rudra create and annihilate only after being empowered by Viṣṇu. Therefore Lord Viṣṇu is certainly eternally worshipable to all the demigods headed by Brahmā and Rudra.”</p><p>It further stated in the <em>Siddhānta-ratna</em>, Third <em>Pāda</em>, texts 13-14: “In the <em>Skanda Purāṇa</em> it is stated that Lord Viṣṇu kept some names like Nārāyaṇa for Himself, and He gave some names like Brahmā and Rudra to the demigods. As a king gives villages other than his own capitol to his ministers and servants for their residence, the supremely independent Personality of Godhead Viṣṇu also gives names other than a few special ones to the demigods for their use.</p><p>“Rudra is known for deriding the desire for liberation and for having a fierce form. Therefore it is stated in the <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> (1.2.26):</p><p>mumukṣavo ghora-rūpān   hitvā bhūta-patīn atha<br />nārāyaṇa-kalāḥśāntā   bhajanti hy anasūyavaḥ</p><p>`Those who are serious about liberation are certainly nonenvious, and they respect all. Yet they reject the horrible and ghastly forms of the demigods and worship only the all-blissful forms of Lord Viṣṇu and His plenary portions.'”</p><p>It has already been shown by quoting Vyāsadeva's words and it has been proved by quoting the Purāṇic incident mentioned in <em>Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata</em> that Śrī Bhuvaneśvara should not be seen as a fierce form of Rudra or as an ordinary <em>liṅga</em>. In the consideration of pure Vaiṣṇavas, Śrī Bhuvaneśvara is most dear to Kṛṣṇa and is therefore nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa. The Śrī Rūpānuga Vaiṣṇavas consider Śrī Bhuvaneśvara in the form of Śrī Gopālinī-śakti and pray to him for the service of the divine young couple, Śrī Śrī Rādhā-Govinda.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.400</p><p><strong>TEXT 400</strong></p><p>śikṣā-guru īśvarera śikṣā ye nā māne<br />nija-doṣe duḥkha pāya sei saba jane</p><p><strong>Those who do not follow the teachings of the Supreme Lord, who is the instructing spiritual master of all, suffer miseries because of their own faults.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.401</p><p><strong>TEXT 401</strong></p><p>sei śiva-grāme prabhu bhakta-vṛnda-saṅge<br />śiva-liṅga dekhi' dekhi' bhramilena raṅge</p><p><strong>In that abode of Śiva, the Lord and His associates happily wandered about seeing the Śiva-liṅgas.</strong></p><p>Of the deities situated within the walls of the temple, Ekāmraka-śiva is situated at the base of the mango tree and is facing west. North of the mango tree is a Śiva-liṅga named Ugreśvara, who is the chief of eleven hundred thousand <em>liṅgas</em>. Beyond him is Viśveśvara-liṅga. West of Gaṇanātha are Nandī and Mahākāla. These two were worshiped by Citragupta, so they are also known as Citragupteśa. Nearby is Sabareśvara-liṅga. In the southwest is Laḍḍukeśvara Śiva, the chief of nine hundred thousand <em>liṅgas</em>. Near him is Śakreśvara Śiva.</p><p>Bindu-sarovara, Ananta Vāsudeva, Puruṣottama, Padaharā, Tīrtheśvara, and Bhuvaneśvara, who is the combination of eight forms, are found in the first of eight concentric rings. Kapila-kuṇḍa, Pāpanāśana-kuṇḍa, Maitreśa, and Vāruṇeśa are situated in the second ring. Beyond this is Pāpanāśana-tīrtha.</p><p>South of Pāpanāśana-kuṇḍa is Īśāneśvara Śiva. Northwest of him is Yameśvara-liṅga. Gaṅgeśvara-liṅga is situated in the third concentric ring. Gaṅgā and Yamunā flow a short distance northeast of there. In the Satya-yuga, Gaṅgā and Yamunā flowed there slowly with a desire to see Bhuvaneśvara and offered prayers to Bhuvaneśvara by chanting mantras from the four <em>Vedas</em>. When Bhuvaneśvara was satisfied by their prayers and asked what they desired, they expressed their desire to live eternally in Ekāmraka-kṣetra. Śrī Bhuvaneśvara then awarded them a place in the southeast. By taking bath in these two <em>tīrthas</em>—Gaṅgā and Yamunā one attains devotional service to Viṣṇu, the result of taking bath in the Gaṅgā and Yamunā. There is also a place known as Devī-pada-tīrtha in this third ring. We have already described the Purāṇic incident regarding this Devī-pada-tīrtha. The beautiful lake that Pārvatīdevī created after killing the two demons Kṛtti and Vāsa is renowned as Devī-pada-tīrtha. By taking bath in that Devī-pada-tīrtha and worshiping Gopālinī on the eighth day of the waxing moon in the month of Phālguna one attains one's desired results. Southeast of this <em>tīrtha</em> Śrī Lakṣmīdevī established a <em>liṅga</em> in a temple constructed by Viśvakarmā. That <em>liṅga</em> is known as Lakṣmīśvara. In the fourth ring, Koṭī-tīrtha and Koṭīśvara are situated. When the demigods attempted to construct temples in Bhuvaneśvara, Śrī Bhuvaneśvara ordered them through a voice in the sky to perform a sacrifice in the northeast corner. When the demigods followed his order by constructing temples, establishing deities, performing fire sacrifices, and offering prayers, Bhuvaneśvara was pleased and decided to give them a benediction. The demigods then prayed that their sacrificial pit would become a <em>tīrtha,</em> and their desire was fulfilled. This place is renowned as Koṭī-tīrtha. By taking bath in this Koṭī-tīrtha, one attains the supreme destination. In the fourth ring, the Śiva-liṅga known as Svarṇa-jaleśvara is situated. This Svarṇa-jaleśvara-liṅga is situated 70 <em>dhanu</em>, or 280 cubits (a cubit is about a foot and a half), northeast of Bindu-sarovara. Near this <em>liṅga</em> there is a <em>kuṇḍa</em>, the water of which is used for bathing the <em>liṅga</em>. There is a Svarneśvara-liṅga within that<em> kuṇḍa</em>.</p><p>Sureśvara-tīrtha, which measures 200 cubit in diameter, is situated four hundred cubits northeast of Bhuvaneśvara. Sureśvara Mahādeva is situated there. Nearby are Siddheśvara, Mukteśvara, Svarṇa-jaleśvara, Parameśvara, Āmrātakeśvara, Brahmeśvara, Megheśvara, Kedāreśvara, Cakreśvara, Viśveśvara, and Kapileśvara. By worshiping these <em>liṅgas</em> one attains devotional service to Viṣṇu. Southeast of Siddheśvara is the famous Kedāreśvara, a Śiva-liṅga that faces south. East of Siddheśvara is Cakreśvara Śiva, and beyond that is Yajñeśvara, or Indreśvara, Śiva.</p><p>The demigods worshiped that <em>liṅga</em> out of devotion to Viṣṇu and had Viśvakarmā construct a temple. As a result, Bhuvaneśa (Viṣṇu) became pleased and gave them the benediction that this <em>liṅga</em> would be known as Siddheśvara, because Śiva, who is very dear to Viṣṇu, was directly present in that <em>liṅga</em> and would award perfection in the worship of Viṣṇu. Siddhāśrama, which awards perfection, is situated 800 cubits from the Siddheśvara-liṅga. Near Siddhāśrama is Mukteśvara Śiva. Near Mukteśvara is Siddha-kuṇḍa, and south of Siddha-kuṇḍa is Puṇya-kuṇḍa. South of Siddheśvara is Kedāradeva, with Gaurīdevī situated by his side. Near Gaurīdevī is Gaurī-kuṇḍa. Since Himālaya worshiped that <em>liṅga</em>, it became known as Hema-kedāra. Streams of crystal clear water emanate west, south, and north of this <em>liṅga</em>. In front of this self-manifested <em>liṅga</em> is a Bhava-pīṭha. Near this Bhava-pīṭha there are three Rudra-liṅgas—Śānti-śiva, Śānta-śiva, and Daityeśvara—who were worshiped by the Maruts. Hiraṇyakaśipu heard a voice from the sky say, “Worship Daityeśvara-śiva, who is generally worshiped by the Daityas and who is situated west of Siddheśvara.” East of Siddheśvara is Indreśvara, who was worshiped by Indra. In the fifth concentric ring there is Brahmeśvara-liṅga and Brahma-kuṇḍa, which appeared during the sacrifice performed by Brahmā. Four hundred forty cubits northeast (a little southeast) past Kṛtti-Vāsa is Gokarṇeśvara. Suṣeṇa and Gokarṇāsura worshiped this <em>liṅga</em>. Near this <em>liṅga</em> are Utpaleśvara and Āmrātakeśvara liṅgas. In the sixth ring Megheśvara-liṅga is situated. Since this <em>liṅga</em>, which is 6800 cubits northeast of <em>kalpa-vṛkṣa</em>, was established and worshiped by the clouds (<em>megha</em>), this <em>liṅga</em> became renowned as Megheśvara. West of Megheśvara is Bhāskareśvara-liṅga, which was worshiped by Bhāskara, the sun-god. Mahādeva and Sūrya are perpetually worshiped six thousand cubits past this place. Three thousand two hundred cubits west of Bhāskareśvara is Kapāla-mocana-śiva. In the seventh ring is Alābu-tīrtha. When one <em>brāhmaṇa</em> friend of Indra performed austerities for one thousand years of the demigods, Bhuvaneśa became pleased with him and awarded him the benediction that his begging bowl and waterpot (made of <em>alābu</em>, or squash) would transform into a <em>tīrtha</em>. When the Lord touched that waterpot, it turned into a divine lake. South of this lake is Auttareśa. Auttareśvara is situated west of Kedāreśvara. This three-eyed <em>liṅga</em> is effulgent, marked with the impression of the moon on his forehead, decorated with a garland of planets and stars, smeared with the ashes from a funeral pyre, decorated with snakes, endowed with a fierce face, and naked. Near this Auttareśvara-liṅga there are three witches who are fond of flesh and blood, who are fully intoxicated, who have crooked reddish eyes, and who are fond of singing and playing instruments. It is heard that Vasiṣṭha and Vāmadeva live at this place. Near this place there is a <em>liṅga</em> named Bhīmeśa, who takes away everyone's fear. In the eighth ring there is a Rāma-kuṇḍa, also called Aśoka-jhara, which appeared from the Aśvamedha (horse) sacrifice. Within this ring are <em>liṅgas</em> like Rāmeśvara, Sīteśvara, Hanumadīśvara, Lakṣmaṇīśvara, Bharateśvara, Śatrughneśvara, Laveśvara, and Gosahasreśvara.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.402</p><p><strong>TEXT 402</strong></p><p>parama nibhṛta eka dekhi' śiva-sthāna<br />sukhī hailā śrī-gaurasundara bhagavāna</p><p><strong>When Śrī Gaurasundara saw a temple of Śiva in a most solitary place, He became joyful.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.403</p><p><strong>TEXT 403</strong></p><p>sei grāme yateka āchaye devālaya<br />saba dekhilena śrī-gaurāṅga mahāśaya</p><p><strong>Lord Gaurāṅga visited all the temples in that place.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 2.404</p><p><strong>TEXT 404</strong></p><p>ei mate sarva-pathe santoṣe āsite<br />uttarilā āsi' prabhu kamalapurete</p><p><strong>In this way the Lord happily traveled all the way and eventually arrived at Kamalapura.</strong></p><p>In this regard one should see <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em> (<em>Madhya</em> 5.141), which states: <em>kamalapure āsi bhārgīnadī-snāna kaila</em>—“When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu arrived at Kamalapura, He took His bath in the Bhārgīnadī River.” The flag on top of the Jagannātha temple can be seen from this village.

Being bewildered by the Lord's illusory energy and considering Mahāprabhu an ordinary living entity and a <em>sannyāsī</em>, Sārvabhauma gave the Lord various instructions and ascertained the uselessness of accepting Māyāvāda <em>sannyāsa</em> in Vaiṣṇava dharma. He also quoted statements of Śrī Śaṅkarācārya to substantiate that it was not Śrī Śaṅkara's internal intention to establish the philosophy of oneness between the living entities and the Lord. On the pretext of humility the Lord revealed to Sārvabhauma that His sole purpose in accepting <em>sannyāsa</em> was to display the pastime of cultivating Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya was considering Mahāprabhu as simply an exalted <em>sannyāsī</em>. When Mahāprabhu inquired from Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya about the meaning of the <em>ātmārāma</em> verse, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya explained it in thirteen different ways. Without touching any of those explanations, Mahāprabhu astonished Sārvabhauma with many new meanings and then displayed to Sārvabhauma His six-armed form. Sārvabhauma thus fell unconscious to the ground, and Mahāprabhu brought him back to consciousness by placing His hand on Sārvabhauma's body. Then, out of His causeless mercy, Mahāprabhu placed His lotus feet on the chest of Sārvabhauma, who by the Lord's mercy became filled with ecstasy and profusely repented for his audacity of previously instructing Mahāprabhu. He then prayed to the Lord for loving devotional service and began to glorify Him by composing one hundred verses. Mahāprabhu then told Sārvabhauma that persons who recite those one hundred verses, called <em>Sārvabhauma-śataka, </em>would certainly attain pure devotional service to Him. The Lord also told Sārvabhauma not to inform the public about the six-armed form that He had manifested for as long as He remained in this world. After delivering Sārvabhauma, the Lord made the lives of the residents of Nīlācala successful by distributing to them the mellows of the holy names of Hari. Gradually devotees like Śrī Paramānanda Purī, Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara, Pradyumna Miśra, and Rāya Rāmānanda came to join the Lord and began to enjoy ecstatic <em>saṅkīrtana</em> pastimes with the Lord. While taking <em>darśana</em> of Lord Jagannātha, Śrī Nityānanda, who was intoxicated by the mellows of ecstatic love for Śrī Caitanya, would sometimes attempt to grab Jagannātha. One day He climbed on the golden throne, and after embracing Balarāma, He took the flower garland from Balarāma's neck and put it on His own neck. Mahāprabhu lived with the devotees on the seashore and would pass the entire night enjoying <em>kīrtana</em> pastimes and displaying symptoms of ecstatic love. The Lord would exhibit wonderful ecstatic emotions whenever He heard Śrī Gadādhara Paṇḍita's recitation of <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em>. One day Mahāprabhu came to Śrī Purī Gosvāmī's monastery and found out that the water in his well was unfit for any use. By the Lord's benediction the sacred Ganges entered his well the very next day, and the well was filled with pure water. When Mahāprabhu came to see the well water, He told the devotees that anyone who takes bath in that water would attain pure devotional service to Kṛṣṇa, the same result one attains by taking bath in the Ganges. At that time Mahāprabhu elaborately described the glories of Śrīla Purī Gosvāmī. When Mahāprabhu first arrived in Nīlācala, Pratāparudra, the King of Utkal, was engaged elsewhere in a military campaign, so he was not able to see the Lord. After Mahāprabhu stayed for some time in Nīlācala, He returned to Gauḍa-deśa. In spite of trying to live secretly in Vidyānagara at the house of Vidyā Vācaspati, the brother of Sārvabhauma, news of His arrival was made public and the place of Vācaspati filled with people. On hearing the loud commotion of the holy name of Hari, Mahāprabhu gave <em>darśana</em> to everyone. He blessed everyone by saying, “May your minds be fixed on Kṛṣṇa,” and He instructed them to worship Kṛṣṇa. In order to avoid the crowd Mahāprabhu secretly left for Kuliyā without informing Vācaspati. Meanwhile, Vācaspati became afflicted by the Lord's separation on one hand and on the other hand the crowd continually accused him of hiding Mahāprabhu in his house. When Vācaspati heard from a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> about the Lord's departure for Kuliyā, he immediately informed everyone and personally led them to Kuliyā. To counter people's baseless charge against Vācaspati, Mahāprabhu, on Vācaspati's request, gave <em>darśana</em> to everyone and made their lives glorious by awarding them the mellows of <em>saṅkīrtana</em> desired by the best of the sages and yogis. When a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> asked the Lord about the atonement for committing offenses to a Vaiṣṇava, the Lord said that one who drinks poison should counteract the effect of the poison by drinking nectar with the same mouth. Similarly, glorification of a Vaiṣṇava's transcendental qualities is the only atonement for blaspheming a Vaiṣṇava. By the influence of Vakreśvara Paṇḍita's association, Devānanda Paṇḍita developed faith in Mahāprabhu and attained His mercy. Mahāprabhu described the glories of Vakreśvara Paṇḍita to Devānanda Paṇḍita. After his offense was nullified, Devānanda Paṇḍita developed humility and inquired from the Lord about the process of explaining <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em>. Mahāprabhu replied that pure devotional service is the ultimate goal of <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em>, and that <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> is eternal and unique. Those who try to equate other literatures with <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> or try to equate other opinions, paths, or mental speculations with pure devotional service, which is the goal of <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em>, do not know anything about <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam.</em> Accepting the book <em>Bhāgavata </em>and the devotee <em>Bhāgavata </em>to be nondifferent, one should always serve the <em>Bhāgavata</em> by offerings of glorification. Lord Nityānanda is the personification of the devotional mellows of <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em>. The fully transcendental <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> is not under the jurisdiction of mundane imagination.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 3.001</p><p><strong>TEXT 1</strong></p><p>jaya jaya śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-guṇa-dhāma<br />jaya jaya nityānanda-svarūpera prāṇa</p><p><strong>All glories to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, the reservoir of all transcendental qualities!

So why did You take <em>sannyāsa</em>? What qualification do You have to take <em>sannyāsa</em>? You are too young. Personalities like Mādhavendra Purī have taken <em>sannyāsa</em>, but they have done so after maturely enjoying material life. Before accepting <em>sannyāsa</em>, You should have particularly considered that everyone respects a <em>sannyāsī</em> as a member of the topmost <em>āśrama</em>. Since You have accepted Vaiṣṇava principles, which entail becoming humbler than a blade of grass, what need was there to become a candidate for receiving the highest respect found in social etiquette? Giving up <em>śikhā</em> and <em>brāhmaṇa</em> thread is an example of pride. It is simply the desire to ascend to the highest level of fame.

The Lord went to the village of Rāmakeli, situated on the bank of the Ganges near Gauḍa, with the desire to spend four or five days at a solitary place there. But after news of Mahāprabhu's arrival in Rāmakeli quickly spread everywhere, His loud roaring, <em>kīrtana</em>, crying, and His appeal to everyone to chant the holy name of Hari attracted the attention of even the infidels. When the local constable related the topics of this wonderful <em>sannyāsī</em> to the King, even that infidel King Hussain Shah considered that Mahāprabhu was the Supreme Lord. Still, fearing that it was not impossible that the King's mind might change through the conspiracy of wicked people, some devotees secretly sent a messenger to the Lord requesting Him to leave Rāmakeli. When a <em>brāhmaṇa</em> informed the Lord's associates about this, their hearts filled with anxiety. The Lord, who is the Supersoul of everyone, then instilled fearlessness in them by personally revealing His own omnipotence and His supremacy that is unknown even to the <em>Vedas</em>, and He promised that He would distribute the holy name to everyone in this age except the offenders at the feet of Vaiṣṇavas. Mahāprabhu also predicted that His name would be spread to every town and village throughout the world. Changing His plan to go to Mathurā, Mahāprabhu started walking south from Rāmakeli and eventually reached the house of Advaita in Śāntipura. In this connection the author relates an incident to show the difference between the extraordinary attachment for Lord Caitanya of Śrī Acyutānanda the son of Śrī Advaita and the behavior of Advaita's other so-called sons, who are averse to Lord Caitanya. One day an exalted <em>sannyāsī</em> came to Śrī Advaita's house and inquired from Him about how Keśava Bhāratī was related to Caitanya. According to worldly etiquette Śrī Advaita Ācārya said that Keśava Bhāratī was the spiritual master of Caitanya. On hearing this reply, the five-year-old naked Acyutānanda smilingly yet in an angry mood asked his father what kind of conclusion was it that the Supreme Personality of Godhead Lord Caitanya, the spiritual master of all, has a spiritual master? After hearing this conclusive statement from His five-year-old son Acyutānanda, Śrī Advaita Ācārya said that Acyuta was actually the father and He was the son. Acyutānanda has appeared in this world as His son to teach the actual truth. When after speaking in this way Advaita begged forgiveness from His son, Acyutānanda became embarrassed and bent his head down. And on seeing the proper exchange of etiquette between a perfect father and a perfect son, the <em>sannyāsī</em> became stunned and then happily left that place while chanting the holy name of Hari. In this regard Ṭhākura Vṛndāvana describes the glories of Śrī Acyutānanda, who is fixed at the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya, and the position of Śrī Advaita's other so-called sons, who are fit to be punished by Yamarāja. When Śrī Advaita Ācārya was thus overwhelmed by the behavior of Śrī Acyutānanda, Śrī Gaurasundara arrived there with His associates. Śrīman Mahāprabhu bestowed special mercy on Acyutānanda and stayed at the house of Advaita to enjoy His <em>saṅkīrtana</em> pastimes. Advaita Ācārya then sent a palanquin and some men to Navadvīpa to bring Mother Śacī, who was afflicted with separation from the Lord and who was nondifferent from Mother Yaśodā, to Śāntipura. Immediately after hearing about the Lord's arrival, when Mother Śacī along with Gaṅgādāsa Paṇḍita, Murāri Gupta, and other devotees came to Śāntipura, Mahāprabhu circumambulated her and offered prayers to her by addressing her as Devakī, Yaśodā, Devahūti, Pṛśni, Kauśalyā, and Aditi. The devotees glorified the wonderful extent of Mother Śacī's devotional service and praised the glories of the name <em>āi</em>. Advaita Ācārya took permission from the Lord for Mother Śacī to personally cook and feed Him. After Mother Śacī cooked various types of vegetables and as many as twenty varieties of the Lord's favorite <em>śāka </em>(spinach) and offered them to the Lord, Mahāprabhu relished those foodstuffs with great satisfaction while praising Mother Śacī's wonderful cooking and the stimulation for varieties of service awakened by those various <em>śākas</em>, which are dear to Kṛṣṇa.</p><p>The nectarean remnants of Mahāprabhu were plundered and relished by the devotees. Then Śrī Murāri Gupta recited prayers in glorification to Lord Rāmacandra before Mahāprabhu and His associates. Placing His lotus feet on Murāri's head, Mahāprabhu awarded him the benediction that he would remain the eternal servant of Rāma. When a leper approached Mahāprabhu and related to Him topics of his pathetic condition, Mahāprabhu became very angry, and after declaring that the leper was untouchable and unworthy of being spoken to, Mahāprabhu asked him to leave that place. He further pointed out that if he were unable to tolerate at present the pains of leprosy, then how would he tolerate the pains of suffering for unlimited future births in the hell known as Kumbhipāka? His present pathetic condition was the result of his committing offense at the feet of Śrīvāsa. In this regard Mahāprabhu glorified the unparalleled position of the Vaiṣṇavas by describing how worship of Vaiṣṇavas was superior to worship of Kṛṣṇa and how offense to the Vaiṣṇavas was more grave than offense at the feet of Kṛṣṇa. When the offending leper repented for his offensive act and surrendered at the lotus feet of the Lord, the Lord revealed to him that the only means for getting freedom from offense to a Vaiṣṇava was to sincerely beg forgiveness at the feet of the Vaisnava whom one had offended. When the leper then begged Śrīvāsa for forgiveness, by Śrīvāsa's mercy he became free from offense. At the outset of describing Śrī Mādhavendra Purī's appearance festival the author describes in brief the glories of Śrī Mādhavendra Purī and how he met Śrī Advaita Prabhu. While Mahāprabhu and His associates stayed at the house of Advaita, the appearance festival of Śrī Mādhavendra Purī arrived. Śrī Advaita Ācārya Prabhu along with Mahāprabhu and the devotees celebrated the occasion with a huge <em>saṅkīrtana</em> festival. In this regard the author describes the ecstatic condition of Mahāprabhu, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, Śrī Advaita Prabhu, and other devotees during the celebration of the festival, the cooking arrangements made by the Vaiṣṇavas' wives under the direction of Mother Śacī, Mahāprabhu's ecstasy in the <em>kīrtana,</em> His revelation of Advaita's glories and the method for worshiping Kṛṣṇa's dear devotee Lord Śiva, Mahāprabhu and the devotee's <em>kīrtana</em> during the festival honoring Mādhavendra Purī, the Lord's pastime of honoring <em>prasāda,</em> and topics such as the Lord's offering flower garlands and sandalwood pulp to the devotees headed by Śrī Nityānanda.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.001</p><p><strong>TEXT 1</strong></p><p>jaya jaya kṛpā-sindhu jaya gauracandra<br />jaya jaya sakala-maṅgala-pada-dvandva</p><p><strong>All glories to Gauracandra, the ocean of mercy!

The inhabitants of that village were all <em>brāhmaṇas</em>.</strong></p><p>Śrī Rāmakeli is situated eight and a half miles south of English Bazaar, near the present city of Maldah. Within this village there is a concrete-paved area, and in the middle of this there is a large <em>tamāla </em>tree with two <em>kadamba</em> trees on each side of it. The two <em>kadamba</em> trees on the right side are referred to as Śrī Advaita Prabhu, the middle <em>tamāla </em>tree is referred to as Śrī Gaurasundara, and the two <em>kadamba</em> trees on the left side are referred to as Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu. It is said that Śrīman Mahāprabhu first met Śrīla Rūpa and Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī Prabhus in the dead of night under this tree. Sitting in this place, Śrīman Mahāprabhu instructed Śrī Sanātana to join Him. Next to the <em>kadamba</em> trees there is a small temple wherein Śrī Madana-mohanadeva is worshiped. The Deity of Śrī Madana-mohanadeva was established by Śrī Rūpa and Sanātana. There are four sets of Deities within this temple. One of those sets is Śrī Baladeva and Revatī. The names of the Deities, from left, are (1) Vraja-mohana (with Rādhā), (2) Revatī-ramaṇa (with Revatī), and (3) Madana-mohana and (4) Gopīnātha (both with Rādhā). There are also <em>śālagrāma-śilās</em> in the temple. In the midst of the Deities there are two Deities of Śrī Gaurasundara, one of Śrī Advaita Prabhu, and one of Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu. There are one hundred twenty-five <em>bighās</em> of land (about forty-two acres) allotted to the service of the Deities. From the public a sum of one hundred twenty-two rupees was collected, out of which eighty rupees was given to the government.</p><p>North of the Śrī Madana-mohana temple is Śrī Sanātana-kuṇḍa. Around that place are eight other <em>kuṇḍas</em> headed by Rādhā-kuṇḍa, Śyāma-kuṇḍa, Lalitā-kuṇḍa, and Viśākhā-kuṇḍa. A little distance from here is a large lake named Śrī Rūpa-sāgara, which was established by Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī. This Rūpa-sāgara is situated between the Śrī Madana-mohana temple and the court of Hussain Shah. The bathing <em>ghāṭas</em> of Rūpa-sāgara are covered with marble. On one of those marble slabs it is written: “This Rūpa-sāgara-ghāṭa of Śrī Rāmakeli was built in 1268 of the Bengali era from the donations of the mercantile communities of the Maldah district of Bengal. The water covers ten <em>bighās </em>(about three and a half acres), and with the banks it covers 20 <em>bighās </em>(about six and a half acres).”</p><p>About a quarter of a mile south of Śrī Rāmakeli is a large hall that is named Bāra-duyārī, because it has twelve doors. Up to 1801, during the time of Krent Sahib, the pillars of this hall were covered with gold. This hall is known by people as the court of Hussain Shah. It is said that Dabira Khāsa had his office in this court. There are four gateways situated on the four sides of this hall. It is said that the King used to enjoy <em>hāoyā</em>, or fresh air, at the Hāoyāsa-khāna-ghāṭa. It is further said that when Śrī Sanātana escaped from prison by giving seven thousand gold coins to the Yavana guard, he crossed the Ganges that night, came to this place, and began to cry out, “Śrī Gaurāṅga! Śrī Gaurāṅga!”At that time a crocodile came there and circumambulated Śrī Sanātana seven times. Śrī Sanātana then sat on the back of that crocodile and crossed the Ganges. Śrī Gaṅgādevī presently flows about a half mile from the Śrī Madana-mohana temple. Apart from these, many glories of Hussain Shah Bādasāha are still present there. There is a <em>dakhala-daraoyājā</em> (the main entrance), a <em>parikhā</em> (the moat), and a <em>phiroja khān</em> (the oldest ruin—a tall tower from which one could see the entire city of ancient Gauḍa). There are also ruins of the treasury, the library, and the Loṭana Mosque (which is one of the finest examples of architectural work). Before Moslem rule, this place was the capital of Lakṣmaṇa Sena known as Lakṣmaṇāvatī. Its ruins can still be seen here.</p><p>The capital of the Sena dynasty situated in the Maldah district was the capital of Gauḍa. The Ganges presently flows some distance from this place. The village of Rāmakeli is situated a short distance from the capital of Gauḍa. Both Śrī Sanātana and Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī used to live in this village of Rāmakeli.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.006</p><p><strong>TEXT 6</strong></p><p>dina-cāri-pāñca prabhu sei puṇya-sthāne<br />āsiyā rahilā yena keha nāhi jāne</p><p><strong>The Lord came to that holy place and stayed there for four or five days without the knowledge of others.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.007</p><p><strong>TEXT 7</strong></p><p>sūryera udaya ki kakhana gopya haya?<br />sarva loka śunilena caitanya-vijaya</p><p><strong>How is it possible to hide the sun?

The most pious people chanted the names of Puṇḍarīkākṣa and Govinda only at the time of taking bath. People intoxicated with material life would never discuss the glorification of Kṛṣṇa, Vaiṣṇavas, or the purpose of Kṛṣṇa's variegated pastimes. On seeing such abominable behavior of the materialistic people, Śrī Mādhavendra became particularly unhappy. Mādhavendra Purī did not even try to converse with the best of <em>sannyāsīs</em> who proudly claimed to be Nārāyaṇa. He merged in an ocean of distress because he saw that the people of the entire world were devoid of devotional service. Although he introduced the performance of congregationally glorifying Kṛṣṇa's pastimes with the desire to deliver such people, they could not understand his intention. The so-called <em>jñānīs</em>, yogis, ascetics, and <em>sannyāsīs</em> could not understand the glories of devotional service to the Supreme Lord.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.424</p><p><strong>TEXT 424</strong></p><p>yata adhyapaka saba tarka se vākhāne<br />tārā saba kṛṣṇera vigraha nāhi māne</p><p><strong>All the teachers simply taught dry argument.

The desire that Advaita nourished in His heart as a bud now had the opportunity to blossom. Many people think that one should take mantra and instruction from a family guru and that there is no need to consider whether that guru has devotion to Kṛṣṇa or not, or that they will attain auspiciousness by artificially learning devotional service from those who deceive ordinary people to attain fame by manifesting eight kinds of bodily transformations while clapping their hands. Some time ago the practices of heating the body by binding a piece of garlic to the throat and shedding tears by rubbing the eyes with hands smeared with chili powder were accepted as limbs of devotional service by deceitful people, who thereby always remained inert and artificially shed tears from their dry eyes. To deliver the unfortunate people whose hearts were captured by the unauthorized practice of taking instructions from such deceitful people, persons who take shelter at the feet of Advaita genuinely cultivate and aspire for Śrī Mādhavendra's transformations of ecstatic love, which are devoid of the desire for enjoying wealth, women, and fame. Śrī Gauḍīya Maṭha does not encourage any form of duplicity. Therefore the sincere servants of Gauḍīya Maṭha are followers of Śrī Mādhavendra Purī and instructors for uprooting these cheating practices.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.441</p><p><strong>TEXT 441</strong></p><p>mādhava-purīra ārādhanāra divase<br />sarvasva nikṣepa kare advaita hariṣe</p><p><strong>Since then, Advaita joyfully celebrated Mādhavendra Purī's appearance day every year.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.442</p><p><strong>TEXT 442</strong></p><p>daive sei puṇya-tithi āsiyā mililā<br />santoṣe advaita sajja karite lāgilā</p><p><strong>By divine arrangement that auspicious day arrived, and Advaita happily began to make arrangements for the occasion.</strong></p><p>The word <em>sajja </em>means “arrangements” or “preparations.”</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.443</p><p><strong>TEXT 443</strong></p><p>śrī-gaurasundara saba-pāriṣada-sane<br />baḍa sukhī hailena sei puṇya-dine</p><p><strong>Śrī Gaurasundara and His associates all felt great happiness on that auspicious day.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.444</p><p><strong>TEXT 444</strong></p><p>sei tithi pūjibāre ācārya-gosāñi<br />yata sajja karilena, tāra anta nāi</p><p><strong>There was no end to the arrangements made by Ācārya Gosāñi to celebrate that occasion.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.445</p><p><strong>TEXT 445</strong></p><p>nānā dik haite sajja lāgila āsite<br />hena nāhi jāni ke ānaye kon bhite</p><p><strong>Ingredients flowed in from all directions.

Śrī Gauḍīya Maṭha does not encourage such non-Vaiṣṇava festivals. The grand festivals of the Gauḍīya Maṭha are always celebrated by enthusiastic devotees with life.

The Gauḍīya Maṭha devotees with life are not accumulators of such lifeless wealth. They say that when preachers become lifeless and entrust the responsibility of preaching to hired preachers, then if the hired preachers accumulate excess wealth, they become enjoyers rather than servants.

At the meeting between Vāsudeva Datta Ṭhākura and Mahāprabhu, Mahāprabhu narrated the glories of Vāsudeva Datta. Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita and his brother Rāmāi were very dear to Mahāprabhu on account of their unlimited services like performing <em>saṅkīrtana</em>, reciting <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam,</em> and performing dramas. One day Mahāprabhu asked Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita why he didn’t endeavor at all to feed and cloth his extensive family. How would he maintain their livelihood? In reply, Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita said that he did not wish to go anywhere to earn money, for whatever was destined would certainly happen. Then Mahāprabhu said, “Śrīvāsa, you should take <em>sannyāsa</em>.”Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita replied, “I cannot do that.” Mahāprabhu said, “Then how will you maintain your family members?”Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita clapped his hands and counted, “One, two, three.” Mahāprabhu asked him the meaning of this, and Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita said, “If I do not get any food even after fasting for three consecutive days, then I will tie a heavy pitcher to my neck and jump into the Ganges.” As soon as Mahāprabhu heard Śrīvāsa’s words, He roared loudly and said, “Even if Lakṣmī, the goddess of fortune, happens to beg, you will not be affected by poverty. Did you forget My words in <em>Bhagavad-gītā </em>that anyone who thinks of Me without deviation (<em>ananyāś cinta</em>), I supply what they lack and preserve what they have? For someone who is personally maintained by the supreme maintainer of the entire universe, what anxiety will he have for food and cloth? I give you the benediction that even if you sit at home, all ingredients for Kṛṣṇa’s service will automatically come to you.” Mahāprabhu then ordered Rāmāi to continually serve his elder brother and exalted Vaiṣṇava Śrīvāsa.</p><p>From Śrīvāsa’s house, Mahāprabhu went to Rāghava Paṇḍita’s house in Pānihāṭi, where many devotees gathered to see the Lord. The Lord privately instructed Rāghava Paṇḍita to see Himself (Śrī Gaurasundara) and Nityānanda as nondifferent, and He ordered Makaradhvaja Kara to serve Śrī Rāghava Paṇḍita. Thereafter Mahāprabhu went from Pānihāṭi to a house in Varāhanagara belonging to a particular devotee <em>brāhmaṇa</em> who was expert in reciting<em> Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em>. On hearing his recitation of <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam,</em> the Lord became especially pleased and awarded him the designation Bhāgavata Ācārya.</p><p>In this way the Lord stayed in various devotees’ houses in each of the villages along the banks of the Ganges in Bengal and performed <em>kīrtana</em> and dancing and fulfilled the desires of everyone, then He again went to Nīlācala and stayed at the house of Kāśī Miśra. On hearing that Mahāprabhu had returned to Nīlācala, King Pratāparudra came to Purī from his capital of Cuttack and displayed intense eagerness to see the Lord as he made special requests to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and other devotees to arrange for him to meet the Lord. When the devotees saw the King’s intense eagerness, they advised him to watch the Lord’s dancing from a hidden place. But when the King saw saliva frothing from the Lord’s mouth, dust on the Lord’s body, and other symptoms Mahāprabhu displayed while dancing in transcendental madness, he was unable to understand Mahāprabhu’s transcendental ecstatic transformations and after falling asleep with a doubtful mind he saw in a dream that the body of Śrī Jagannātha was also covered with saliva and dust. When the King tried to touch Śrī Jagannātha in the dream, Jagannātha cautioned him by saying, “Your bodily limbs adorned with sandalwood pulp mixed with musk are never fit to touch My body covered with saliva and dust.” At that moment King Pratāparudra saw Śrī Caitanyadeva sitting in the same place where Jagannātha had been sitting and His body covered in the same way with saliva and dust. As the King attempted to touch Him, Śrī Gaurahari said to Pratāparudra, “Since you have aversion for Me in your mind, why do you want to touch Me?” As the King woke up, he became extremely repentant and realized that Śrī Gaurasundara was nondifferent from Śrī Jagannātha.</p><p>One day as Mahāprabhu was sitting in a flower garden with His associates, King Pratāparudra came and offered obeisances to the Lord by falling flat like an uprooted banana tree and symptoms of ecstatic love manifested in the body of the King. The King then began to speak to the Lord with utmost humility. The Lord showered His merciful benediction on the King and told him that He came to Nīlācala only for the sake of Rāya Rāmānanda, Sārvabhauma, and Pratāparudra. He also told the King that he should not reveal the actual identity of the Lord, who was enacting the pastimes of a covered incarnation, for as long as the Lord was present on this planet. The Lord then offered the garland He was wearing to the King and gave him permission to leave.</p><p>One day in Nīlācala, Śrī Mahāprabhu called Nityānanda to a solitary place, and while discussing with Him about the preaching of pure devotional service in Bengal, the Lord sent Nityānanda along with His associates to Bengal to fulfill His mission there. During their journey to Bengal the eternally perfect Vraja associates of Śrī Baladeva Nityānanda manifested their self-evident sentiments of Vraja. Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu went to the house of Rāghava Paṇḍita in Pānihāṭi, where Nityānanda heard a <em>kīrtana</em> performed by the expert <em>kīrtana</em> leader Mādhava Ghoṣa and became absorbed in wonderful ecstatic love. As Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu climbed on the throne of Lord Viṣṇu, the devotees headed by Rāghava Paṇḍita performed the Lord’s <em>abhiṣeka</em> ceremony. When Nityānanda Prabhu ordered Rāghava Paṇḍita to quickly bring a garland of <em>kadamba</em> flowers, Rāghava Paṇḍita saw that by the will of Śrī Nityānanda many <em>kadamba</em> flowers had blossomed out of season in the lime tree situated in his courtyard. Rāghava Paṇḍita prepared a garland from those <em>kadamba</em> flowers and offered it to Nityānanda. Shortly thereafter, the ten directions were suddenly filled with the aroma of <em>damanaka</em> (Artemisia indica) flowers, and Nityānanda explained that Śrī Gaurasundara had put on a garland of <em>damanaka</em> flowers and come from Nīlācala to hear the <em>kīrtana</em>. Then Nityānanda and His associates all manifested transformations of ecstatic love. Śrī Nityānanda stayed in Pānihāṭi for three months and exhibited various pastimes of devotional service. Lord Nityānanda Prabhu used to decorate His body with various ornaments. Along with His associates, Nityānanda visited the houses of the devotees situated on both sides of the Ganges. The children were showered with His mercy.</p><p>One day Śrī Nityānanda went to the house of Śrī Gadādhara dāsa. In the course of this narration there is a description of Śrī Gadādhara Dāsa’s eternal mood as a <em>gopī</em>. Śrī Nityānanda took the Bāla-gopāla Deity from Śrī Dāsa Gadādhara Prabhu’s temple and embraced put Him to His chest. When Śrī Nityānanda heard Śrī Mādhavānanda’s song describing the <em>dāna-khaṇḍa-līlā</em>, the pastimes of taking taxes, symptoms of ecstatic love manifested in His body. In Gadādhara dāsa’s village lived one Kazi, who was very envious, cruel, and opposed to <em>kīrtana</em>. One day while intoxicated by love of God, Dāsa Gadādhara Prabhu fearlessly went at night to the house of the Kazi while chanting the name of Hari and said, “Where is that fellow Kazi? He better chant the name of Kṛṣṇa quickly, or I will break his head.” When the Kazi came before Dāsa Gadādhara and asked why he was coming to the house of an atheist like him, Dāsa Gadādhara replied, “During the incarnation of Śrī Caitanya and Nityānanda everyone in the world has chanted the name of Kṛṣṇa, only you have remained aloof. I have come to make you chant the name of Hari.” The Kazi replied, “Gadādhara, you go home today, I will chant the name of Hari tomorrow.” On hearing the Kazi say the name Hari, Gadādhara said, “Why tomorrow? You have already chanted the name of Hari.” At this point the author describes various wonderful symptoms of love of God manifested by the associates of Śrī Nityānanda. Thereafter Nityānanda with His associates departed for Navadvīpa to see Mother Śacī, and on the way they stayed at Purandara Paṇḍita’s temple in Khaḍadaha. While describing at this point the most wonderful transformations of loving devotional service manifested by Śrī Caitanya’s servant Murāri Paṇḍita, the author then refutes the sinful activities of the so-called servants of Śrī Caitanya who independently identify themselves with pride as followers of Śrī Advaita. After spending a few days at Khaḍadaha, Śrī Nityānanda and His associates went to the village of Saptagrāma and took bath there at the Triveṇī bathing <em>ghāṭa</em> on the banks of the Ganges. He stayed on the bank at the Triveṇī in the house of Uddhāraṇa Datta, and He inspired the entire mercantile community to worship Kṛṣṇa by preaching the holy names of Kṛṣṇa from door to door. Even godless Yavanas took shelter at the lotus feet of Śrī Nityānanda, the deliverer of the fallen souls.</p><p>After some time Śrī Nityānanda came to Śrī Advaita’s house in Śāntipura. Śrī Advaita Ācārya offered prayers to Nityānanda Prabhu, and then the two spent the entire day in great ecstasy discussing topics of Kṛṣṇa. From Śāntipura, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu went to Navadvīpa and went straight to Śrīdhāma Māyāpur to meet Mother Śacī. Śrī Nityānanda and His associates enjoyed ecstatic <em>kīrtana</em> pastimes in Navadvīpa and enacted pastimes of delivering the fallen souls. In this connection the author describes an incident involving a dacoit of Navadvīpa. In Navadvīpa there was a particular young <em>brāhmaṇa,</em> who was the leader of the dacoits. That leader of dacoits saw the opulent ornaments on the body of Śrī Nityānanda and desired to steal them. Thinking in this way, he began to travel with Nityānanda with a desire to steal His ornaments. Realizing that Śrī Nityānanda was living alone at the house of Hiraṇya Paṇḍita, that leader of dacoits along with his fellow dacoits waited at night fully prepared in a solitary place near the house of Hiraṇya Paṇḍita. They began to contemplate who would take which ornament of Nityānanda. But by the will of Śrī Nityānanda, the dacoits soon fell asleep. When they woke early the next morning to the sound of the crows, they hastily hid their weapons at some place and returned to their respective home while blaming each other. On the next night the dacoits first worshiped goddess Caṇḍī with great pomp by offering her wine and flesh, and after collecting various weapons and wearing <em>kavacas,</em> or protective amulets, they surrounded the house of Nityānanda at the dead of night. But contrary to their expectations they found innumerable, fully prepared, fierce-looking soldiers who were constantly chanting the name of Hari were guarding the house of Nityānanda. They became greatly astonished to see this and after making various arguments among themselves they concluded that there is no hope of their success on that particular night and left. When on the third night the dacoits entered into the residence of Śrī Nityānanda, they immediately lost their sight and started falling into filthy pits and thorny bushes. At that moment Lord Indra began to shower heavy rain and storm there by making the lives of the dacoits miserable. After this incident the leader of the dacoits had a change of heart, so he took shelter at the lotus feet of Nityānanda and prayed for his own deliverance while offering prayers to Nityānanda. Śrī Nityānanda bestowed mercy on the leader of the dacoits by forbidding him to again engage in sinful activities while misusing his independence. Moreover, Śrī Nityānanda delivered other dacoits through this leader of the dacoits. In this connection the author describes the glories of Nityānanda’s mercy, His preaching of the holy names throughout Navadvīpa, His frequent visits to Kulīyā on the other side of the Ganges, the characteristics of Śrī Nityānanda’s associates, a brief introduction of some of Nityānanda’s associates, and himself as the last servant of Nityānanda and the son of Nārāyaṇī devī, a recipient of Caitanya’s mercy.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 5.001</p><p><strong>TEXT 1</strong></p><p>jaya jaya śrī-gaurasundara sarva-guru<br />jaya jaya bhakta-jana-vāñchā-kalpa-taru</p><p><strong>All glories to Śrī Gaurasundara, the spiritual master of everyone!

Since the Māyāvādīs’ extreme arrogance and the ritualistic <em>smārtas’</em> pride born of adeptness became impediments in their attaining devotional service to the Supreme Lord, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, who was unhappy to see the distress of others, went to Gauḍa-deśa to fulfill the internal desire of Śrīman Mahāprabhu.

Anyone who considers this sinful person a follower of Advaita could not and cannot understand the mentality of Advaita.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 5.441</p><p><strong>TEXT 441</strong></p><p>e pāpīre ’advaitera loka’ bale ye<br />advaita-hṛdaya kabhu nāhi jāne se</p><p><strong>One who considers such a sinful person a follower of Advaita never understands the heart of Advaita.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 5.442</p><p><strong>TEXT 442</strong></p><p>rākṣasera nāma yena kahe ’puṇya-jana’<br />ei mata e saba caitanya-dāsa-gaṇa</p><p><strong>These persons may be known by the name Caitanya dāsa, or servant of Caitanya, just as demons are known by the name <em>puṇya-jana, </em>or pious person.</strong></p><p>In Sanskrit language the phrase <em>puṇya-jana</em> is used as a synonym for Rākṣasa, or demon.

Those who do not understand the deep meaning of the phrase <em>puṇya-jana</em> consider that it has a good connotation, but in actuality it is used to give the opposite meaning. Similarly, if names like Caitanya dāsa are not indicative of the actual meaning but are used to indicate an offender of Lord Caitanya, then the person with such a name can never become an actual servant of Lord Caitanya.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 5.443</p><p><strong>TEXT 443</strong></p><p>kata-dine thāki’ nityānanda khaḍadahe<br />saptagrāma āilena sarva-gaṇa-sahe</p><p><strong>After passing some days at Khaḍadaha, Nityānanda went with His associates to Saptagrāma.</strong></p><p>For an elaborate description of Saptagrāma, see the <em>Anubhāṣya</em> commentary on <em>Caitanya-caritāmṛta</em>, <em>Ādi-līlā</em>, Chapter Eleven, text 41.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 5.444</p><p><strong>TEXT 444</strong></p><p>sei saptagrāme āche-sapta-ṛṣi-sthāna<br />jagate vidita se ’triveṇī-ghāṭa’ nāma</p><p><strong>In this village of Saptagrāma there is a place associated with the seven sages known throughout the world as Triveṇī-ghāṭa.</strong></p><p>The confluence of the Ganges, Sarasvatī, and Yamunā is known as Triveṇī even today.

When there is no longer a propensity for committing further sin, a person desires to be relieved of the reactions for the sins he has committed. If that desire is sincere, then there is no possibility of reviving the propensity to commit sin. But if one is not completely free from sin, then the seed of sin naturally induces one to engage again in sinful activities.

By chanting the name of Hari, love for Kṛṣṇa is awakened and one becomes qualified to relish the topmost transcendental mellows.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 5.699</p><p><strong>TEXT 699</strong></p><p>kṛṣṇa-preme matta, kṛṣṇa-gāna nirantara<br />nityānanda-prabhu hena karuṇā-sāgara</p><p><strong>They became intoxicated with love for Kṛṣṇa and constantly chanted Kṛṣṇa’s names.

Many people who did not understand his actual position misunderstood him as an <em>ahaṅgrahopāsaka</em>, or one who worships himself as the Supreme. Actually Rāmadāsa was always eager to gratify the senses of the Supreme Lord. Since foolish Māyāvādīs consider the living entities and the Supreme Brahman as one, they cannot understand the endeavors of the devotees. Once Śrī Rāmadāsa concealed his mood as a servant and Kṛṣṇa entered his body and resided there for three months.

Even though that <em>brāhmaṇa</em> had firm faith in the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya, he developed some doubt in Nityānanda Prabhu’ s behavior, which was beyond Vedic rules and regulations. This <em>brāhmaṇa</em> went one time to Nīlācala and secretly revealed to Śrīman Mahāprabhu his doubts about Śrī Nityānanda. He said that everyone calls Nityānanda a <em>sannyāsī,</em> and a <em>sannyāsī</em> is prohibited to touch any object made of metal; but Nityānanda is always decorated with various gold, silver, and jewel-studded ornaments; He wears fine silk cloth rather than saffron loincloth; He carries an iron rod rather than a <em>daṇḍa</em>; He always stays and eats at the houses of <em>śūdras</em>;<em> </em>and as such His behavior is not seen to be in accordance with the <em>śāstras</em>. Why should a person who is accepted by everyone as a great personality act in a way that is contrary to the principles of <em>āśrama</em>?</p><p>To remove the doubts of that <em>brāhmaṇa</em>, Mahāprabhu quoted evidence from <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> to establish that the faults seen through mundane vision in <em>uttama-adhikārī </em>Vaiṣṇavas are not actually faults. Lord Kṛṣṇacandra is supremely independent, and as such He constantly resides and enjoys pastimes within the body of the <em>uttama-adhikārī </em>Vaiṣṇava. Therefore all activities of an <em>uttama-adhikārī </em>are meant for Kṛṣṇa’s pleasure. This is possible only for a nonduplicitous <em>uttama-adhikārī </em>Vaiṣṇava. Only Rudra can drink poison and be addressed as Nīlakaṇṭha; it is not possible for others. By imitating the activities and behavior of an <em>uttama-adhikārī, </em>one’s destruction is inevitable. In this regard Śrī Gaurasundara quoted two verses from the Tenth Canto of <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> as evidence. He also described an incident from the Eighty-fifth Chapter of the Tenth Canto of <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> as an example of how severely one has to suffer and take birth in sinful species of life if he even makes comments on the external so-called sinful activities of nonduplicitous exalted personalities. When even perfected personalities can suffer unlimited miseries and fall into the pit of karma by ridiculing the behavior of a transcendental <em>mahā-bhāgavata </em>Vaiṣṇava, then what can be said about ordinary people? The worship and pretension of chanting the holy names performed by a person who worships Viṣṇu and chants the holy name (?) of Hari but blasphemes the devotees of Hari are all useless. And a person who engages with love and devotion in the service of the devotees of the Supreme Lord can undoubtedly attain the service of Kṛṣṇa. A person who makes a show of worshiping Viṣṇu but disregards the worship of a Vaiṣṇava is a proud person. The characteristics of the supremely independent Śrī Nityānanda, who is nondifferent from Baladeva, are incomprehensible and inconceivable to ordinary living entities. They are beyond all rules and regulations. If anyone even unknowingly blasphemes Nityānanda, he will fall down forever even after achieving the devotional service of Viṣṇu.</p><p>To inform everyone of these instructions, Śrī Gaurasundara immediately sent that <em>brāhmaṇa</em> to Navadvīpa.</p><p>Śrī Gaurasundara said, “Anyone who has unflinching love for Nityānanda certainly has love for Me also. Of this, there is no doubt. Being nondifferent from Baladeva, Śrī Nityānanda is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even if He ever appears to drink wine or associate with women, He is eternally worshipable for Lord Brahmā.”</p><p>After hearing these words from Śrī Mahāprabhu, the doubts of that <em>brāhmaṇa</em> were destroyed and he developed faith in the lotus feet of Śrī Nityānanda. The <em>brāhmaṇa</em> went to Navadvīpa and immediately begged forgiveness for his offences from Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu and thus attained His mercy.</p><p>In conclusion, Ṭhākura Vṛndāvana explains that even if different people from different statuses of life say anything about Śrī Nityānanda, if a living entity somehow or other takes shelter of Nityānanda and Gauracandra, then, as a worshiper of the spiritual master and Gaurāṅga, that person certainly becomes worshipable to the author. “Nityānanda alone is my eternal master, and I am His eternal servant, birth after birth. I beg everyone for servitorship to Nityānanda. If, in spite of Śrī Nityānanda’s matchless glories, a person blasphemes Him, then there is no possibility of auspiciousness for that person other than a kick from the lotus feet of Nityānanda’s servants.” The author concludes this chapter by describing the service of Śrī Nitāi-Gaura along with Their associates and attributes.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 6.001</p><p><strong>TEXT 1</strong></p><p>jaya jaya gauracandra jaya nityānanda<br />jaya jaya prabhura yateka bhakta-vṛnda</p><p><strong>All glories to Gauracandra!

Then again, the intelligent persons who considered that giving up objects related to Hari was <em>phalgu-vairāgya</em>, or false renunciation, took pleasure in Nityānanda Prabhu’s preaching.</p><p>According to the injunctions of the scriptures, a <em>sannyāsī</em> is prohibited from accepting objects of enjoyment like scented oil, sandalwood paste, and betel nuts, but the precocious, proud, <em>prākṛta-sahajiyās</em> freely enjoy an abundance of betel nuts on the pretext of honoring <em>prasāda</em>. Since the imitation of <em>paramahaṁsa</em> behavior by such unqualified people is always condemnable, ordinary foolish people fell into illusion by considering even Śrī Nityānanda, the original shelter of <em>paramahaṁsa </em>principles, as a <em>vivikta</em> (dry renunciant) or a <em>dhīra-sannyāsī</em> (neophyte <em>sannyāsī</em>).</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 6.018</p><p><strong>TEXT 18</strong></p><p>dhātu-dravya paraśite nāhi sannyāsīre<br />sonā, rūpā, muktā se tāṅhāra kalevare</p><p><strong>“A <em>sannyāsī</em> is prohibited from touching items made of metal, but His body is decorated with gold, silver, and pearls.</strong></p><p>The <em>prākṛta-sahajiyās</em> say that at the present time Śrī Rāmakṛṣṇa dāsa has protected the honor of the <em>sannyāsa</em>-<em>āśrama</em> by refusing to accept items made of metal. A devotee <em>sannyāsī</em> should not use gold and silver like Śrī Nityānanda. There is no doubt that the principles of the independent Vedic <em>sannyāsī</em> become polluted by using these items, but if one internally considers himself a <em>paramahaṁsa </em>and externally does not use items made of metal, the desire for fame will capture his heart and, as a result of cheating people, such behavior will be accepted as low-class.</p><p>If one refrains from using items made of metal during processions and festivals because people will criticize, and if one displays poverty in the performance of the Lord’s service, then the misguided, materialistic philanthropists will not be able to understand the purport of the verse beginning <em>ārādhanānāṁ sarveṣāṁ</em>. If in the present day one gives up saffron loincloth and becomes misguided by wearing fine silk cloth and decorating his body with sandalwood paste and flower garlands, then, as a result of imitating the behavior of <em>paramahaṁsas</em>, he will bring about his own ruination. And if some portion of the ideal characteristics of Śrī Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi, Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya, and Śrīmat Nityānanda Prabhu is seen in a devotee situated in <em>paramahaṁsa </em>principles and devoid by nature of the desire for fame, then every intelligent person will understand.

If as a result of committing offenses described in verses like <em>arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīr</em>, one sees Lord Viṣṇu as equal to other personalities, then he is certain to go to hell. People who are puffed-up with false ego and cheated by mundane knowledge bring about their own ruination by seeing them through external vision as equal. As a result, they fall from the lotus feet of Gopīnātha. What to speak of this, they even fall from the lotus feet of Āloyārnātha. When a person loses the good fortune of serving Āloyārnātha, he begins to worship the Jagannātha of the <em>pañcopāsakas</em>. While worshiping Jagannātha, he fixes his mind in the worship of Bhuvaneśvara. Thereafter, when he commits offense at the feet of Bhuvaneśvara, the best of the devotees, he develops the propensity to perform pious activities. As a result, the desire awakens in him to take bath in and perform fruitive activities at the Vaitaraṇī River in Yājapura. When he falls from pious activities and begins to commit sinful activities, he becomes <em>ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā,</em> or bewildered by false ego, and the sense of considering himself the doer distracts him from the path of spiritual life. When he further increases his offenses, he becomes averse to seeing the beauty of Śrī Gopīnātha’s lotus feet. Therefore, those who have not discussed the purport of the Vedic statement: <em>nāyam ātmā bala-hīnena</em> (“One cannot attain the goal of life without the mercy of Balarāma”) are inevitably degraded. Without the mercy of Nityānanda Prabhu, no living entity can attain any auspiciousness. If as a result of mundane knowledge one feels powerful and gives up the service of Baladeva, then he cannot attain the good fortune of serving Kṛṣṇa.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 6.119</p><p><strong>TEXT 119</strong></p><p>nā bujhiyā ninde tāṅra caritra agādha<br />pāiyā o viṣṇu-bhakti haya tāra vādha</p><p><strong>“If one who does not understand Him blasphemes His unfathomable characteristics, then his advancement will be checked, even if he has attained the devotional service of Viṣṇu.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 6.120</p><p><strong>TEXT 120</strong></p><p>cala vipra, tumi śīghra navadvīpe yāo<br />ei kathā kahi’ tumi sabāre bujhāo</p><p><strong>“O <em>brāhmaṇa</em>, go quickly to Navadvīpa.

It is impossible for a person who has no love for the lotus feet of Śrī Guru and Vaiṣṇava to attain Kṛṣṇa’s mercy. Love for one’s fellow human beings and service to the conditioned souls cannot attract the Supreme Lord’s love. The conditional knowledge of a living entity is dispelled only by the influence of service to Śrī Guru and Vaiṣṇava. As a result of the knowledge of one’s relationship to Kṛṣṇa that the spiritual master imparts in their ears, the conditioned souls develop love for Śrī Hari, Guru, and Vaiṣṇava and engage in their eternal service. On that platform, the spirit of material enjoyment cannot attack them. The taste that sinful people develop by accepting misconceptions about so-called gurus and the Supreme Lord, the original shelter, is completely separate from the eternal truth and is simply illusion. That is why Śrī Gaurasundara used the word <em>satya </em>three times.

It is not proper for the Lord’s devotees to have any relationship with those who associate with any atheist envious of Nityānanda, whose body is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa. The qualification to serve the lotus feet of the spiritual master diminishes by the influence of bad association. Therefore one should never act in a way that will disrupt remembrance of one’s spiritual master, who is the unalloyed eternal servant of Śrī Gaurasundara and whose body is nondifferent from Śrī Gaurasundara. Those who use spiritual life for material gain are not devotees but servants of sense gratification. A so-called devotee and a devotee have completely opposite characteristics. That is why it is very unfortunate to consider those who indulge in materialistic association as members of a spiritual society. When one invites his own destruction, he becomes deprived of spiritual life and considers the spiritual master, who is nondifferent from Nityānanda, as separate from Śrī Nityānanda, the <em>prakāśa-vigraha</em> of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya.

When Śrī Gaurasundara came alone to that garden to meet Śrī Nityānanda, the Lord offered prayers to Nityānanda by reciting the <em>śloka</em> beginning <em>gṛnhīyād yavanī pānin</em> and then circumambulated Him. Śrī Nityānanda also manifested ecstatic love upon seeing the moonlike face of Śrī Gaura. A current of great ecstasy swelled in the loving conversation between Śrī Caitanya and Nityānanda. While glorifying Śrī Nityānanda, Śrīman Mahāprabhu said that the gold, silver, pearls, <em>rudrākṣa</em>, etc., that are found on Śrī Nityānanda’s body are the nine types of devotional service. Śrī Nityānanda has awarded to even fallen souls the most rare loving devotional service that is desired by even great sages and mystic yogis, and Nityānanda is capable of giving away even Lord Kṛṣṇa, who is supremely independent. Nityānanda is the personification of the mellows of devotional service to Kṛṣṇa, and the body of Nityānanda is the abode of Kṛṣṇa’s pastimes. Śrī Nityānanda also revealed His own subordinate nature to Śrī Gaurasundara.</p><p>Mahāprabhu said that the nine types of devotional service certainly adorn the transcendental limbs of Śrī Nityānanda as His ornaments. As ordinary people who do not understand why Lord Śiva decorates his head with a snake imagine or think differently about him, similarly, on seeing the ornaments on Śrī Nityānanda’s transcendental body, people proud of their material knowledge become offenders at His lotus feet. Lord Śiva is the servant of Śrī Saṅkarṣaṇa, or Śrī Ananta, so out of love for his worshipable Lord, Śiva always keeps Śrī Ananta on his head. Similarly, for the pleasure of Śrī Gaurasundara, Śrī Nityānanda also decorates His transcendental body with the ornaments of the nine types of devotional service. Fortunate persons can understand these confidential topics, and thus they become happy and attain service at the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Sinful people, however, become destroyed by being deceived by their material knowledge. Śrī Nityānanda and His associates are Śrī Baladeva and Baladeva’s associates of Vraja. The devotional sentiments enjoyed by the associates of Nanda Mahārāja are present on the transcendental body of Śrī Nityānanda as His ornaments.</p><p>Śrī Caitanya and Śrī Nityānanda sat in that solitary flower garden and discussed confidential topics and the rare transcendental sentiments of Gokula desired by personalities like Śrī Uddhava. In this regard the author glorifies the supreme position of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya and warns about the grave consequences a person faces if, without understanding the confidential loving quarrels between Śrī Nityānanda and Śrī Gauracandra, he takes the side of one Lord and blasphemes the other Lord.</p><p>After taking leave from Nityānanda, Śrī Gaurasundara returned to His own residence. Śrī Nityānanda went to see Lord Jagannātha, where He manifested pastimes of <em>mahābhāva, </em>and from there He went to the house of Śrī Gadādhara Paṇḍita in one garden. The Deity of Gopīnātha was situated in the house of Gadādhara. This Deity is so attractive that even the hearts of atheists become melted on seeing Him. Śrī Caitanyadeva personally embraced this Deity. When Śrī Gadādhara heard the news of Śrī Nityānanda’s arrival at his house, he left his recitation of <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> and came to greet Him. During their meeting, they both became overwhelmed with love while glorifying each other. Neither of them would ever converse with the other’s enemy. Gadādhara resolved that he would never see the face of a person who blasphemes Nityānanda.</p><p>Śrī Gadādhara Paṇḍita invited Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu to have lunch at his house, and Śrī Nityānanda gave Gadādhara Paṇḍita some fine rice fit for offering the Lord that He had personally brought from Bengal for offering to Gopīnātha. He also presented a beautiful colored cloth to Gopīnātha. Gadādhara put that colored cloth on the transcendental body of Śrī Gopīnātha. He then cooked the rice that Nityānanda had brought from Bengal and offered it to Gopīnātha along with vegetables and a preparation of spinach picked from the courtyard of the Ṭoṭā-gopīnātha temple.</p><p>At that time Śrī Gaurasundara also arrived at Gadādhara’s house and told Gadādhara that He was certainly entitled to a portion of Nityānanda’s goods, Gadādhara’s cooking, and Gopīnātha’s remnants. On hearing Śrī Mahāprabhu’s merciful words, Gadādhara became extremely happy, and he placed a plate of Gopīnātha’s <em>prasāda</em> before Mahāprabhu. While honoring the rice given by Nityānanda and while praising the cooking of Gadādhara, Mahāprabhu manifested the pastime of honoring Gopīnātha’s <em>prasāda</em>. Śrī Gaurasundara, Nityānanda, and Gadādhara finished their pastime of honoring <em>prasāda</em> in the midst of laughing and teasing each other. Then the devotees gathered there plundered the remnants of the three Prabhus.</p><p>Ṭhākura Vṛndāvana concludes this chapter by declaring that one who hears or reads about Śrī Gaura-Nityānanda’s pastime of eating at the house of Gadādhara will attain devotional service and by describing topics of Gaura, Gadādhara, and Nityānanda’s living together in Nīlācala.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 7.001</p><p><strong>TEXT 1</strong></p><p>jaya jaya śrī-vaikuṇṭha-nātha gauracandra<br />jaya jaya śrī-sevā-vigraha nityānanda</p><p><strong>All glories to Śrī Gauracandra, the Lord of Vaikuṇṭha!

He also describes Śrī Advaita Ācārya and other devotees’ arrival in Nīlācala with their wives, sons, servants, and maidservants; Mahāprabhu’s going to Āṭhāranālā to receive Śrī Advaita Ācārya; Balarāma, Kṛṣṇa, and Govinda’ s arrival at the lake called Narendra-sarovara for the Candana-yātrā ceremony; the Lord’s watching the Candana-yātrā festival along with the devotees from Bengal; the Lord’s performance of water sports in Narendra-sarovara; the Lord’s taking <em>darśana</em> of Lord Jagannātha; Mahāprabhu’s pastime of setting the example of serving <em>tulasī</em>; Śrī Advaita Ācārya’s glorification of Mahāprabhu’s associates and their unique position; and the transcendental position of the Vaiṣṇavas.</p><p>When the time for Lord Jagannātha’s Ratha-yātrā festival came closer, the devotees from Bengal left for Nīlācala to see the Ratha-yātrā festival under the order of Śrīman Mahāprabhu. Paṇḍita Śrīvāsa, Śrī Candraśekhara, Paṇḍita Gadādhara dāsa, Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi, Paṇḍita Vakreśvara, Pradyumna Brahmacārī, Ṭhākura Haridāsa, Vāsudeva Datta Ṭhākura, Śrī Mukunda Datta Ṭhākura, Śivānanda Sena, Govindānanda, the scribe Vijaya dāsa, Sadāśiva Paṇḍita, Puruṣottama Sañjaya, Nandana Ācārya, Śuklāmbara Brahmacārī, Śrīdhara, Bhagavān Paṇḍita, Gopīnātha Paṇḍita, Śrīgarbha Paṇḍita, Vanamālī Paṇḍita, Jagadiśa and Hiraṇya Paṇḍita, Buddhimanta Khān, Ācārya Purandara, Murāri Gupta, Garuḍa Paṇḍita, Gopīnātha Siṁha, Śrī Rāma Paṇḍita, Nārāyaṇa Paṇḍita, Paṇḍita Dāmodara who had gone to see Mother Śacī, and Śrī Advaita Prabhu took various eatables that were dear to the Lord and journeyed with their wives, sons, servants, maidservants, and relatives to Nīlācala while chanting the holy names of Kṛṣṇa along the way. At Kamalapura the devotees saw the flag on top of the Jagannātha temple and offered their respectful obeisances.</p><p>Mahāprabhu could understand that the devotees from Bengal headed by Śrī Advaita were coming, so He had sent Jagannātha <em>mahā-prasāda </em>all the way to Cuttack to welcome them and He personally led the devotees of Nīlācala to Āṭhāranālā to greet the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas. As the devotees of Bengal headed by Śrī Advaita and the devotees of Nīlācala headed by Śrī Gaurasundara met each other at Āṭhāranālā, their great ecstasy swelled and overflowed like the confluence of the Ganges and the ocean. Then, keeping Śrī Mahāprabhu in front, the Śrī Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas went to the banks of Narendra-sarovara while performing <em>saṅkīrtana </em>and dancing in ecstasy. Since by the arrangement of providence the Candana-yātrā, or boat festival of Śrī Rāma-Kṛṣṇa-Govinda, fell on that day, the devotees from Bengal and the devotees from Nīlācala together performed a huge <em>kīrtana</em>. On seeing the boat festival of Śrī Rāma-Kṛṣṇa-Govinda, Mahāprabhu jumped into the water of Narendra-sarovara with the devotees and performed various water sports.</p><p>Although all kinds of people such as materialists, <em>sannyāsīs, </em>and <em>brahmacārīs </em>engaged in swimming in the waters of Narendra lake during the boat festival of Śrī Rāma-Kṛṣṇa-Govinda, by the influence of Śrī Caitanya’s illusory energy, they could not come anywhere near Śrī Caitanya or His devotees. Śrī Caitanya’s mercy is obtainable only by unmotivated service attitude. It is not possible to associate with Śrī Caitanya and His devotees or see their pastimes through education, wealth, or austerities. Not understanding the transcendental glories of chanting of the holy name of Hari, the proud Māyāvādī <em>sannyāsīs</em> fall down by regularly blaspheming Śrī Caitanyadeva for failing to study Vedānta, practice <em>prāṇāyāma, </em>or execute duties befitting a <em>sannyāsī</em>. Although some exalted <em>sannyāsīs </em>glorify Śrī Caitanyadeva as a <em>mahājana</em>, some consider Him a learned scholar, and some consider Him a great devotee, they are unable to understand the actual identity of Śrī Caitanya. Since Gaurasundara, who is nondifferent from the son of the King of Vraja, and His devotees, who are nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa’s associates of Vraja, engaged in water sports in Narendra-sarovara, the waters of Narendra became as fortunate as the rivers Yamunā and Ganges.</p><p>After completing their water sports in Narendra, Śrīman Mahāprabhu along with His devotees went to the Jagannātha temple to see Lord Jagannātha. On seeing both moving and stationary Jagannātha together, the devotees offered repeated obeisances to Them. Kāśī Miśra greeted all the devotees with remnants of Lord Jagannātha’s garland. The Lord, enacting the pastime of an instructing spiritual master, displayed the pastime of accepting the remnants of Jagannātha’s garland. Śrīman Mahāprabhu alone knows the glories of serving the Vaiṣṇavas, <em>tulasī</em>, the Ganges, and <em>mahā-prasāda</em>. Mahāprabhu therefore taught Vaiṣṇavas the principles of devotional service by exhibiting the pastime of offering obeisances to the swanlike Vaiṣṇavas. The renounced order of life is the topmost among the <em>āśramas</em>. If the son of a person takes <em>sannyāsa,</em> then even the formerly respectable father of that son must offer his son respects. In the same way, Mahāprabhu, the all-respectable Supreme Lord engaged in pastimes as a <em>sannyāsī,</em> used to display the pastime of offering respect to the Vaiṣṇavas in order to reveal the supremacy of the swanlike Vaiṣṇavas.</p><p>Mahāprabhu’s pastimes of worshiping <em>tulasī</em> were unique. The Lord would fill a small pot with choice dirt and plant <em>tulasī</em> in it. Then whenever the Lord would walk in the street chanting the name of Hari, someone would walk with that potted <em>tulasī</em> in front of the Lord. Thus the Lord would chant the holy name while seeing and following <em>tulasī</em>. Whenever Mahāprabhu would sit down and chant, He would place <em>tulasī</em> by His side so that He could see her while chanting the holy name. Śrīman Mahāprabhu declared that He could not live without seeing <em>tulasī</em> as a fish cannot live out of water. Only those who, rather than imitate, sincerely follow <em>śikṣā-guru </em>Nārāyaṇa’s teachings under the guidance of the spiritual master and the Vaiṣṇavas are delivered from the hands of inauspiciousness.</p><p>After taking <em>darśana</em> of Lord Jagannātha, Śrī Mahāprabhu returned to His residence with the devotees. The Lord, who is like a desire tree for the devotees, would satisfy the devotees according to their respective desires. Mahāprabhu always kept the devotees with Him, showing them affection as one would his own son, and the devotees also constantly remained absorbed in the blissful service of the Lord. The devotees from Bengal and Nīlācala lived together and engaged in <em>kṛṣṇa-kīrtana </em>without consideration of caste or place of birth. By the mercy of Śrī Caitanyadeva, everyone received an opportunity to see the Vaiṣṇavas from Śvetadvīpa. Śrī Advaita Ācārya repeatedly said with His own mouth that only by the mercy of Śrī Caitanya did He also have the opportunity to see those exalted Vaiṣṇavas, whom even the demigods are unable to see. The Vaiṣṇavas are actually the Supreme Lord’s eternal associates, who accompany the Lord when He descends in this world. Just as Lord Vāsudeva appears with Pradyumna, Aniruddha, and Saṅkarṣaṇa, and as Lord Rāmacandra appears with Lakṣmaṇa, Bharata, and Śatrughna, similarly, these Vaiṣṇavas appear by the order of Mahāprabhu to assist the Lord in His pastimes.</p><p>Therefore the birth and pastimes enjoyed by Vaiṣṇavas are not the fruits of their karma. By the Lord’s will the Vaiṣṇavas appear in this world to assist the Lord in His pastimes, and by the Lord’s will they disappear from this world.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 8.001</p><p><strong>TEXT 1</strong></p><p>jaya jaya mahāprabhu śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya<br />jaya jaya nityānanda tribhuvana-dhanya</p><p><strong>All glories to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu!

The duty of genuine <em>tridaṇḍi-sannyāsīs </em>inclined to the service of Kṛṣṇa is to perform <em>kīrtana</em> rather than observe silence, display anger to those who are envious of the devotees, make friendship with devotees, and engage in the service of Kṛṣṇa rather than engage the body, mind, and speech in pursuit of sense gratification. But foolish proud people consider dancing and singing in ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa as equal to dancing and singing based on material enjoyment.

In this case it is understood that the Lord chanted a fixed number of names while sitting next to a <em>tulasī</em> plant. Śrī Gaurasundara exhibited the pastime of associating with <em>keśava-priyā tulasī</em> to teach those who do not consider the association of <em>kṛṣṇa-priyā tulasī</em> as favorable to devotional service but rather accept her as an ordinary plant. <em>Tulasī</em> is <em>tadīya</em>, or related to Kṛṣṇa.

One day Advaita Prabhu invited Mahāprabhu for lunch and personally cooked for the Lord. Advaita’s wife assisted Him by making all the arrangements for cooking. Śrī Advaita Ācārya had the desire to feed Mahāprabhu alone to His heart’s satisfaction and suddenly, by the arrangement of providence, the <em>sannyāsīs </em>who usually ate with the Lord were separated from Him. Thus Mahāprabhu went alone to the house of Advaita and fulfilled His desire. Since Indra assisted Advaita Ācārya in His discharge of devotional service to Kṛṣṇa by sending a storm and rain, Advaita Ācārya began to offer Indra prayers, considering him a servant of Kṛṣṇa. Understanding Advaita Ācārya’s heart, Mahāprabhu glorified Advaita by saying that it was not at all astonishing that Indra would follow the order of one whose resolution even Lord Kṛṣṇa was bound to fulfill. The so-called followers of Advaita who rather than accept Śrī Advaita Ācārya’s subordination to Śrī Caitanya think otherwise are not fit to be seen by Advaita Ācārya.</p><p>When Dāmodara Paṇḍita returned from Bengal and Mahāprabhu asked him about Mother Śacī’s devotional service to Viṣṇu, the impartial Dāmodara glorified Mother Śacī as <em>mūrtimatī viṣṇu-bhakti</em>, the embodiment of devotional service to Lord Viṣṇu, and described the glories of the word <em>āi</em>. Mahāprabhu, who was performing the pastimes of teaching ordinary people, asked Dāmodara such a question just to teach ordinary people. Inquiries about one’s devotional service to Kṛṣṇa are proper inquiries about someone’s well-being. Devotees of Viṣṇu are certainly wealthy. Mahāprabhu let everyone know that He would not eat at anyone’s house unless that person chants one hundred thousand names of Hari. Therefore, for the sake of feeding Mahāprabhu, many devotees began to chant one hundred thousand names of Hari.</p><p>One day when Mahāprabhu asked Śrī Keśava Bhārati whether <em>jñāna </em>or devotional service was superior, Bhāratipāda replied that devotional service was certainly superior; because exalted personalities like Brahmā, Śiva, Nārada, Prahlāda, Śukadeva, Vyāsa, the four Kumāras, the Pāṇḍavas headed by Yudhiṣṭhira, Prīyavrata, Pṛthu, Dhruva, Akrūra, and Uddhava have all prayed for devotional service at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord. Some of them even begged for devotional service after giving up their previous attachment for <em>jñāna</em>. Therefore the path of devotional service approved by the <em>mahājanas </em>is the ultimate goal for all living entities and for all time. After hearing the words of Bhārati, Mahāprabhu expressed His pleasure and began to dance in ecstasy.</p><p>One day when under the order of Śrī Advaita Ācārya all the devotees began to glorify the names, qualities, and pastimes of the incarnation of Lord Caitanya, the Ācārya began to dance and roar loudly. The Ācārya began to dance with the devotees while chanting a song He personally composed about Lord Caitanya. When Mahāprabhu heard the sound of <em>kīrtana</em> and came there, the devotees under the leadership of Advaita Ācārya began to glorify Lord Caitanya’s names, forms, qualities, and pastimes even more enthusiastically. To protect the mission of His covered incarnation, Mahāprabhu, who is the teacher of all living entities and who accepted the mood of a devotee, left that place and returned to His residence to enact the pastime of going to bed in an angry mood. The devotees headed by Śrīvāsa went to the Lord’s residence, and Mahāprabhu indicated that His identity in His covered incarnation was to remain concealed. In response, Śrīvāsa made a gesture of trying to cover the sun with his two hands to show that by covering a self-manifested object it could never remain hidden. In fact, even if it were possible to cover the sun with one’s hands, it was not possible for Lord Caitanya to remain hidden, for His glories were spread throughout the entire world. At that time, innumerable devotees from various provinces suddenly arrived there glorifying the names, forms, qualities, and pastimes of the incarnation of Śrī Caitanya and thereby substantiated the words of Śrīvāsa. As a result, Mahāprabhu enhanced the glories of His devotee by accepting defeat.</p><p>The science of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya’s position as the origin of all incarnations is accepted through disciplic succession. When He is accepted by personalities like Śrī Advaita and Śrī Nityānanda as the source of all incarnations, and when He exhibits the special characteristics found only in Lord Kṛṣṇa, then to not accept Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead but to consider Him as something else is nothing but atheism.</p><p>When Śrī Rūpa and Sanātana came before Mahāprabhu and expressed their humility, Mahāprabhu glorified their renunciation and instructed them to take shelter of the lotus feet of Śrī Advaita Ācārya to obtain loving devotional service. When Mahāprabhu said that Advaita Ācārya was the storekeeper of devotional service, the Ācārya replied that Mahāprabhu was actually the proprietor of that storehouse, and the storekeeper is allowed to give out goods only under the order of the proprietor. In other words, He revealed His subordination to Mahāprabhu. Mahāprabhu ordered Śrī Rūpa and Sanātana to go to Mathurā-maṇḍala and deliver the people of the western countries from the clutches of sinful activities and improper behavior by preaching pure devotional service. Then Mahāprabhu awarded Sākara Mallika the spiritual name Sanātana.</p><p>When Mahāprabhu inquired from Śrīvāsa about the Vaiṣṇava status of Advaita, Śrīvāsa said that Śrī Advaita Ācārya was a Vaiṣṇava in the category of Śukadeva and Prahlāda. This caused Mahāprabhu to manifest His pastime of anger. In that angry mood the Lord picked up a fishing rod and was about to beat Śrīvāsa. The Lord then revealed that Śrī Advaita was the primeval Lord, the source of all ingredients, the Supersoul of everyone, and the incarnation of Mahā-Viṣṇu; therefore, compared to Him, personalities like Śukadeva and Prahlāda were nothing but children. The exalted author then proves the inconceivable and unique behavior of the perfected Vaiṣṇavas by relating the incident of Bhṛgu described in the Tenth Canto of <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em>. He concludes this chapter by saying that only by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa and by taking shelter of Kṛṣṇa can one realize the difficult to comprehend characteristics of the Vaiṣṇavas.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 9.001</p><p><strong>TEXT 1</strong></p><p>jaya jaya śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya ramā-kānta<br />jaya sarva-vaiṣṇavera vallabha ekānta</p><p><strong>All glories to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, the husband of the goddess of fortune!

This is the symptom of their great misfortune.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 9.231</p><p><strong>TEXT 231</strong></p><p>śeṣa-śāyī lakṣmī-kānta śrīvatsa-lāñchana<br />kaustubha-bhūṣaṇa āra garuḍa-vāhana</p><p><strong>The Supreme Lord lies on Śeṣa Nāga, He is the husband of the goddess of fortune, His chest is decorated with the mark of Śrīvatsa and the Kaustubha jewel, and His carrier is Garuḍa.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 9.232-233</p><p><strong>TEXT 232-233</strong></p><p>e saba kṛṣṇera cihna jāniha niścaya<br />gaṅgā āra kāro pāda-padme nā janmaya</p><p>śrī-caitanya vinā ihā anye nā sambhave<br />ei kahe vede śāstre sakala vaiṣṇave</p><p><strong>Know for certain that all these symptoms are found in Kṛṣṇa, and that Mother Ganges does not appear from the lotus feet of anyone else.

From Him, all the devotees have appeared. He is the manifestation of Lord Viṣṇu’s <em>upādāna-kāraṇa</em>.

Therefore I will not consider Advaita Prabhu on the same level as living entities attached to indulging in intoxicants and sense gratification.

Like the sun-god, He pervades everything by the rays of His energy. He appears impersonal to imperfect eyes.” One can understand the science of Lord Viṣṇu only on the strength of one’s sincere worship of Gaurasundara. The words of Gaurasundara are certainly equal to Vedic statements. Misunderstanding of the independent Vedic statements disturbs and misdirects the limited knowledge of humans. Just as the science of the Supreme Lord is incomprehensible, the science of the Vaiṣṇavas is incomprehensible to ordinary people.</p><p>In the <em>Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad </em>(3.1.7) it is stated:</p><p>bṛhac ca tad divyam acintya-rūpaṁ<br />sūkṣmāc ca tat sūkṣmataraṁ vibhāti<br />dūrāt sa-dūre tad ihānti ke ca<br />paśyatsv ihaiva nihitaṁ guhāyām</p><p>“The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the greatest.

Ordinary people driven by external knowledge cannot understand this. Transgression of etiquette by Kṛṣṇa’s devotee is seen in the descriptions of Bhṛgu’s characteristics (<em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em>, Canto Ten, Chapter 89). Bhṛgu did not hesitate to place his feet on the chest of the Supreme Lord. Although by ordinary consideration Bhṛgu insulted the Supreme Lord, who is affectionate to His devotees, Bhṛgu demonstrated by his actions his <em>ati viśrambha-bhāva </em>(very confidential mood) and <em>aty āsakti </em>(intense attachment) in the service of the Supreme Lord.

He neglected whatever etiquette a son is expected to show his father.</strong></p><p>Although Bhṛgu was an elder son of Brahmā, Bhṛgu neither offered Brahmā prayers, respectful words, or obeisances at his feet. It is not proper for a son to diminish the prestige of his father in any way, yet Bhṛgu displayed such discourtesy to test Brahmā’s quality of omniscience. This made Brahmā displeased, and he immediately wanted to burn Bhṛgu to ashes. From this it is proved that a close relative could not understand the glories of the devotee Bhṛgu. Therefore Brahmā was not accepted as the best among the <em>guṇa-avatāras</em>. Bhṛgu could understand that Brahmā was not the cause of all causes, he was only the creator of the universe. Later, when the sages pacified Brahmā, his anger subsided. Thereafter Bhṛgu went before Rudra, and Rudra, considering himself senior and Bhṛgu as junior, went to embrace Bhṛgu with affection. Bhṛgu, however, rebuked Rudra. When the junior Bhṛgu displayed such improper behavior to his senior three-eyed brother, Rudra became angry. When Rudra in his form as the annihilator was about to kill Bhṛgu, it took no time for Bhṛgu to understand the position of Rudra. Thereafter Bhṛgu went to the ocean of milk, where he found Lord Viṣṇu, whose lotus feet were served by Lakṣmī, and immediately kicked Lord Viṣṇu. The Lord immediately got up, and rather than becoming angry like Brahmā and Rudra, He joyfully offered respectful obeisances to Bhṛgu and prayed that Bhṛgu would excuse His offense. The Lord further said to Bhṛgu that He accepted the feet of a great devotee on His chest where His maidservant Lakṣmī resides. Pastimes displaying expertise on the path of attachment with intimacy or equality are depicted in various ways in a society of fools. But intelligent devotees display their affection for the Lord and the supreme expertise of devotees by manifesting their humility. That is why we can understand from verses composed by Śrī Mādhavendra Purīpāda, who is renowned for planting the seed of ecstatic love for Kṛṣṇa, that as long as one is under the control of qualities like lust and anger, one continues to remain averse to the service of the Lord. Human beings can become free from the clutches of qualities like lust and anger only when they attain the service of Kṛṣṇa.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 9.329</p><p><strong>TEXT 329</strong></p><p>dekhiyā putrera anādara-vyavahāra<br />krodhe brahmā hailena agni-avatāra</p><p><strong>Seeing the disrespectful behavior of his son, Brahmā became very angry and appeared like the incarnation of Agni.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 9.330</p><p><strong>TEXT 330</strong></p><p>bhasma karibena hena krodhe mana hailā<br />dekhiyā pitāra mūrti bhṛgu palāilā</p><p><strong>When Bhṛgu saw his father’s angry mood, he ran away in fear that he would be cursed and turned to ashes.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 9.331</p><p><strong>TEXT 331</strong></p><p>sabe bujhāilena brahmāra pāye dhari’<br />“putrere ki gosāñi, e-mata krodha kari?”</p><p><strong>Everyone present there held the feet of Brahmā and pacified him, saying, “Please don’t be so cruel to your son.”</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 9.332</p><p><strong>TEXT 332</strong></p><p>tabe putra-snehe brahmā krodha pāsarilā<br />jala pāi’ yena agni susāmya hailā</p><p><strong>Out of affection for his son, Brahmā then controlled his anger as fire is extinguished with water.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 9.333</p><p><strong>TEXT 333</strong></p><p>tabe bhṛgu brahmāre bujhiyā bhāla-mate<br />kailāse āilā maheśvara parīkṣite</p><p><strong>After testing Brahmā, Bhṛgu Muni went directly to Kailāsa to test Śiva.</strong></p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 9.334</p><p><strong>TEXT 334</strong></p><p>bhṛgu dekhi’ maheśvara ānandita haiyā<br />uṭhilā pārvatī-saṅge ādara kariyā</p><p><strong>When Śiva saw Bhṛgu Muni, he became happy.

When Śrī Mahāprabhu took <em>darśana </em>of Lord Jagannātha, however, His eyes would not wander from Lord Jagannātha’s face for even a moment, in fact He would see the moonlike face of Lord Jagannātha everywhere. Advaita Ācārya gladly accepted defeat from Mahāprabhu and said that only Śrī Mahāprabhu knew the confidential meaning of such a statement.</p><p>One day Gadādhara Paṇḍita, the disciple of Puṇḍarīka, informed Mahāprabhu that he had forgotten his initiation mantra and desired to hear it from the Lord. But Mahāprabhu replied to Gadādhara Paṇḍita that he should wait till Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi came to Nīlācala. Mahāprabhu began to hear <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> from Gadādhara Paṇḍita, and in this way He heard the characteristics of Prahlāda and Dhruva hundreds of times. While hearing Gadādhara’s recitation of <em>Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</em> and Svarūpa Dāmodara’s <em>kīrtana,</em> Mahāprabhu simultaneously manifested the eight transformations of ecstatic love. Among the <em>sannyāsīs,</em> Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara and Śrī Paramānanda Purī were the Lord’s principal associates and constant companions. One day, when Mahāprabhu was overwhelmed in ecstatic love of God, He fell into a well, and the devotees headed by Advaita Ācārya pulled the Lord out.</p><p>When Puṇḍarīka arrived at Nīlācala, Mahāprabhu cried with love and Gadādhara took mantra initiation again from Vidyānidhi. During the Oḍana-ṣaṣṭhī festival the servants of Lord Jagannātha would dress Lord Jagannātha and Balarāma with starched cloth. When Puṇḍarīka criticized this behavior of Jagannātha’s servants, Svarūpa Dāmodara explained that the characteristics of the Supreme Lord are beyond the jurisdiction of worldly etiquette. But since this did not satisfy Vidyānidhi, Jagannātha and Balarāma enacting the pastime of slapping Vidyānidhi on his cheeks in a dream in order to destroy the <em>karma jaḍa-smārtas’ </em>sinful mentality of criticizing the behavior of the Supreme Lord’s servants. The Lord distributes mercy in dreams only to His select and dear associates. When Vidyānidhi told Svarūpa Dāmodara about the dream, they both happily joked with each other. Mahāprabhu used to address Vidyānidhi as <em>bāpa</em>, or father. Vidyānidhi’s devotion for the Ganges was genuine and incomparable.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 10.001</p><p><strong>TEXT 1</strong></p><p>jaya jaya gauracandra śrīvatsa-lāñchana<br />jaya śacī-garbha-ratna dharma-sanātana</p><p><strong>All glories to Śrī Gauracandra, who bears the mark of Śrīvatsa!

The special characteristic of Śrī Gaurasundara’s pastimes is the glorification of topics regarding Kṛṣṇa. Since activities like worship and meditation are unable to fully manifest the Supreme Lord, the process of <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is supreme. This <em>saṅkīrtana</em> is the best of all activities for reviving one’s relationship with the Supreme Lord. That is why in His Gaura pastimes Śrī Kṛṣṇacandra is addressed as <em>saṅkīrtana-priya</em>, or He who is fond of <em>saṅkīrtana</em>. He is the supreme worshipable Lord of all devotees. Those who have no love for Him are certainly nondevotees. He is like death personified for both the sinful sense enjoyers and the wicked-minded renunciants.</p><p>CB Antya-khaṇḍa 10.003</p><p><strong>TEXT 3</strong></p><p>bhakta-goṣṭhī-sahita gaurāṅga jaya jaya<br />śunile caitanya-kathā bhakti labhya haya</p><p><strong>All glories to Śrī Gaurāṅga along with His devotees!

The Māyāvādīs’ desire for liberation and the attached householders’ desire for sense gratification did not induce Śrī Dāmodara Svarūpa to indulge in associating with outsiders.
